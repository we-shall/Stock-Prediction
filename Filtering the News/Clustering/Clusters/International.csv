The US move to applytariffson steel and aluminiumimportsto protect its domestic industry resulted in China issuing an intent to impose duties on agricultural goods worth $3 billion imported from the US.', 'Following the publication of the US Trade Representative (USTR) report of its investigation of China, the Trump administration decided to impose 25% tariff on over 1,300 products coming from China, as per the list announced on April 3. These items account for $46 billion of USimportsfrom China.', 'The next day, China announced a list of 106 US products that would be subject to the same tariff rate, impacting almost $50 billion worth of Chineseimportsfrom the US.', 'If, after due process, all thesetariffsare instituted, they would price higher about 15% of bilateral goods trade.', 'April witnessed further trade measures from the two countries directed at each other. The US banned its companies from selling components to Chinese telecom equipment manufacturer ZTE for seven years, citing violations of sanctions against Iran. Anti-dumping deposits were imposed on USexportsof sorghum to China, its major market by far for the product. The US then threatenedtariffson another $100 billionimportsfrom China.', 'Such steps have significant implications for global trade. The US is the world’s largest importer of goods at $2.2 trillion and the second largest exporter with $1.4 trillion, while China ranks top inexportswith $2.1 trillion and second inimportsat $1.4 trillion as of 2016. Merchandise worth $637 billion was exchanged between the two countries in 2017, with two-way flows including services exceeding $711 billion. Volatility resulting from uncertainty about the implementation of threatened tariff measures has hit markets.', 'USTR report', 'The USTR report, on which the recent round of tariff hikes is based, was initiated in August 2017 under Section 301 of the US Trade Act following long-standing complaints from US companies about being pressurised to share technology with China in return for market access. The findings imply that the Chinese government deploys unfair, opaque and unwritten ways to compel American enterprises to open up their proprietary technologies.', 'The report also alleges that China supports and incentivises acquisitions of and investments in US technology firms to gain intellectual property.', 'One key claim of the report is that the Chinese government indulges in ‘unauthorised intrusions’ into US commercial computer networks and cyber theft of intellectual property belonging to US enterprises. The USTR claims are refuted by China.', 'The US-China ‘trade war’ is thus a tussle for technology leadership and strategic dominance. Chinese investments in US technology firms, too, have been on the US radar.  The rapid progress made by China in so-called ‘Industry 4.0’ technologies is causing concern in the US. Given this technology contest, it is likely that trade confrontation of the two countries may continue.', 'India’s trade with the US, China', 'For India, the US is its largest export market and second largest source ofimportswith total trade in goods at $66 billion (April-February 2017-18), as per official data.', 'China remains by far India’s largest import partner with close to $70 billion of goods purchased from the country in the first 11 months of the fiscal year. However, Indianexportsto China were less than $12 billion.', 'If the tariff barriers imposed by the US and China play out as announced, global trade could contract, impacting India’s recent upturn inexports.', 'A possibility could be that the US and China would consider third producers, including India, for their import necessities. Reportedly,Indiahas offered to sell soybean and sugar to China during the Strategic Economic Dialogue held in Beijing in April.', 'India’sexportsof tariff-impacted products', 'Machinery, mechanical appliances and electrical equipment account for $34.2 billion of the 1,300 affected USimportsfrom China. Looking at US import items from China valued at over $500 million, it is found that India’sexportsto the US of these items (at four-digit level) in 2016 were very limited (see table below).', 'Only four of the 15 items aggregated more than $100,000 and none came in over $300,000 value.', 'It is, therefore, unlikely that US demand of these products fromIndiawould pick up considerably in the short term.', 'Regarding Chineseimportsfrom the US on which retaliatorytariffsare proposed, the top category is transportation goods at $27.6 billion, followed by vegetable products ($13.7 billion) and plastics and rubber ($3.5 billion).', 'For all but two of the items for which imported value is over $500 million (at six-digit HS Code), India’sexportsto China are nil or negligible (Table 2 below). The only exceptions are cotton and vehicle parts.', 'Thus,Indiawould probably not be considered by China as a potential replacement source for its USimportsof these goods.', 'Implications for India', 'The above analysis shows thatIndiawould not see much positive trade diversion coming its way from the ongoing US-China trade spat. For one, with about 15% of bilateral trade slated to suffer from higher tariffs, the first and second round spillover impact on world trade from lower bilateral trade would be inimical to Indianexports.', 'Second, the high-value imported goods on whichtariffsare proposed by both countries are not significant in India’s export profile for the two partners. In some cases, such as electrical equipment and machinery,Indialacks manufacturing capacity. In others, as for example, soybeans, China’s import barriers for Indian products have preventedIndiafrom accessing its market.', 'Three, given the current US stance, there is a risk of further trade barriers on USimportsfromIndia.Indiahas been placed on the Priority Watch List in the USTR Special 301 Report for intellectual property rights (IPR) implementation. Its foreign exchange policies are also under US watch. H1B visa regulations have been made tougher, and fewer Indians are applying for them. US has also voiced concerns about hightariffsinIndiafor certain US products.', 'The US has further announced a review of the general system of preferences (GSP) which permitsimportsof certain goods fromIndiaat zero tariffs, impacting $5.6 billion of India’sexportsto the US of key labour-intensive products such as textiles and gems and jewellery. These are part of the overall US protectionist trade sentiments and policies, which could escalate, depending on domestic reaction and global retaliation.', 'On the Chinese side, there has been a reluctance to address India’s trade concerns, including for agricultural products. At the meeting of trade ministers in March, there were no significant outcomes. Hopefully, the upcoming visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to China would take up trade issues.', 'Investment dimension', 'There is some potential for positive diversion toIndiaon the investment side. China’s foreign direct investment (FDI) in the US has dropped considerably in 2017 over the previous year. With Chinese firms taking positions in India’s technology sector, there is a possibility for higher inflows from that direction.', 'US investments inIndiafell between 2015-16 and 2016-17 and stayed muted in the April-December 2017-18 period at a cumulative total of $22 billion from April 2000 to December 2017. Its outward FDI was $299 billion in 2016 alone.', 'Strong efforts would be required to attract the US and Chinese FDI toIndia.', 'Technology implications', 'With technology development and intellectual property rights (IPR) as issues of contention,Indiawill need to be watchful regarding its own position in the evolving Industry 4.0 technologies.Indiacompares well with China in terms of English language proficiency and cultural connect, raising less anxiety about data security and IPR loss.', 'As long asIndiaadheres to a strong IPR regime and continues to encourage non-resident patent applications, it would stand out as a reliable technology partner for the future. However, China’s focused and accelerated approach towards the target of technology dominance should incite deeper strategic thinking in Indian policy circles to avoidIndiabeing marginalised in the technology leadership competition between the US and China.', 'Future direction', 'The US-China trade disputes are part of two larger developments. The first is the general context of strategic geopolitical tensions exhibited within an economic and technological expression. Second is the waning gains that overseas enterprises perceive in a Chinese economy where the trade-off between market access and IPR loss is yielding lower margins.', 'It is unclear which direction the trade tensions could take in coming months. On the one hand, there is the possibility of de-escalation of trade measures and counter-measures, which would require a period of intensive negotiations between the two sides. On the other, the increased clamour from different constituencies (primarily in the US) could lead to further rounds of offensive policies.', 'For India’s policymakers, the fact that the items of interest to the world’s largest traders figure insignificantly in its export basket with these markets flags the country’s continued low penetration of world markets.', 'The Indian government would need to ensure a strategic approach to the many dimensions of the export endeavour in this evolving trade scenario and accelerate export competitiveness in mission mode to reinstate its efficacy as a growth driver for the country. It must also continue to take measures to encourage its R&D engagement and boost technology industries.']"

Ken Lam,shoot the suspect? The suspect appeared to be wielding a weapon as he walked toward Lam, and atthe one point even pleaded with the police officer to shoot him.', 'As a former police officer and someone who studies police issues —including use of force — this situation is a case study on how things can go very right.', 'My initial reaction to the videos of the van driver’s arrest was that the police officer was professional and acting within his own assessment of the situation. This is critical.', 'Canada’s Criminal Codeprovides the legal authority for the use of force, but it does not tell an officer what to do in each situation. Likewise,police use-of-force modelsprovide a framework for training and assistance in decision-making. But like the Criminal Code, they don’t provide a legal basis or a rationale for the use of force in any particular situation.', 'Dead force a possibility', 'When faced with the threat of death or grievous bodily harm, a police officer is authorized to use force to protect themselves or others, up to and including deadly force. With this authority comes significant responsibility.', 'Just because you’re authorized to use deadly force doesn’t mean you always should. There are many times when police officers could legally use deadly force but don’t.', 'Most of these situations do not show up in the news that evening. These situations mostly pass by unnoticed and unreported. This case madeinternationalheadlines due to the nature of the crimes being investigated, and the presence of video footage of the arrest.', 'What went right this time?', 'First, you had a clearly well-trained police officer who was acting in a professional manner. This is what we expect from our police.', 'The suspect had everything going for him in order to survive his arrest. It took place in bright sunlight, but without the sun shining in the officer’s eyes. The suspect was silhouetted against a white van, which likely provided a clearer outline of the object in the suspect’s hands.', 'The suspect did not take a typical shooting stance, but stood upright with his shoulders back. He was not aiming an object, but pointing it from the shoulder.', 'From the video, it appears the suspect was yelling for the police officer to shoot him. He dropped his arm to his side and brought it back up again as if pointing a weapon at the police officer. Again, it he was not a typical shooting stance.', 'Constable de-escalated', 'This officer clearly had de-escalation in mind.', 'He recognized his car siren was on and went back to turn it off. This shows that he did not have tunnel vision or hearing. With the siren off, clearer communications were possible.', 'With a good visual of the subject, the actions of the suspect, his calls to be shot and the artificial manner in which he was standing and threatening, the police officer clearly made a decision that the use of deadly force, while authorized, was not immediately needed.', 'I do not know what the police officer was thinking, but what came to my mind was an attempt by the suspect of a“suicide by cop.”This is a situation where a suspect tries to goad the police into using deadly force.', 'This by itself does not negate the risk to police andothers.There are occasions when the use of deadly force is appropriate even when it is a purposeful attempt to have someone else kill them. Some suspects do follow through on their threats in order to goad police into the use of force. But not this time.', 'Risk assessment for police officers', 'The use-of-force models used by police include a risk assessment that asks the officer to take into account the following:', 'Situational Factors —These include the environment, the number of suspects, the perception of the suspect’s abilities, knowledge of the suspect’s background, time and distance from the suspect and threat cues given by the suspect.', 'Tactical Considerations —Is there a cover, is a backup available?', 'Subject Behaviour —Are they threatening and how are they threatening?', 'Officer’s Perceptions —Their own assessment of the situation and their abilities to handle it.', 'This risk assessment, however, does not provide “the answer” to an officer regardinga shoot or don’t shoot, or any other use of force.', 'What it does provide is a framework for decision-making. This is all part of professional police training.', 'I faced a situation early in my service with the RCMP when I had a male in the sights of my pistol. It was a tense situation, and I felt that the use of deadly force was likely. But my training, in a fraction of a second, took me through an assessment of the situation.', 'I held my fire because I could not see the weapon that was being threatened, and I was behind cover. I held on until the suspect gave up. He was unarmed.', 'Decisionto shoot not easily made', 'I have also worked with officers who had the misfortune to have had to resort to deadly force to save their own lives. It is not a decision that is easily made — and it’s one that can be very personal to the officer in the situation.', 'Their own perception, their own confidence, their training, their reaction to the situation — all have an impact on the outcome.', 'The courts have sided with police in this decision-making process, ruling that the courts must take into account the reasonably held assessment of the circumstances and dangers they find themselves.', 'So in this case, we had a trained officer, acting calmly and professionally, with a clear view of the suspect and the object in his hand, indications of an attempt at “suicide by cop,” de-escalation techniques used and a quick surrender. It all led to a successful arrest without the use of deadly force.', 'One small change in the circumstances and the outcome could have been very different.', 'Police do not use deadly force because of the crime the suspect is alleged to have committed, but only due to the threat posed. This police officer made a heroic call. Const. Lam risked his own life to preserve another’s, even when that person was the suspect in a horrendous act that took so many innocent lives.', 'Glenn Hanna, Assistant Program Head, Justice Studies, University of Guelph-Humber,University of Guelph-Humber', 'This article was originally published onThe Conversation.
