Since this attachment order has no impact on the company's operations, analysts believe investors can use the correction to buy the stock.The uncertainty about the US FDA clearance had also been acting as an overhang for the counter for the past year. However, the company has received good news on this front as the FDA has started giving a nod to its products and facilities; as of now, the company has 171 Abbreviated New Drug Approvals from the FDA.These new approvals explain the continuing improvement in its revenue from the US. The US business, which contributes around 28% to its revenue, grew by 58% on a year-onyear basis, and 21% on a quarter-over-quarter basis in the third quarter of 2012-13.Aurobindo Pharmahas witnessed improved margins over the past few quarters, helped by launches in the US and reduced sales from the low-margin antiretroviral (ARV) formulation contract business. The revenue from the ARV business fell 18% in the third quarter due to the management's decision to bid only for tenders that offer a minimum profitability threshold. Analysts expect the margin to improve during 2013-15 because of a rise in the US sales. The company has recently received the US FDA approval for its Unit IV (and expects approval for its Unit VI), and this should help it ramp up its US sales.Efforts by the company to increase sales through its own channels and reduce dependence on contract manufacturing are the other factors that are likely to result in margin expansion in the future. Though the stock is fundamentally strong and quoting at reasonable valuations, investors should not ignore the risks involved.The stock price may be impacted again if there is any development on the recent step taken by the ED. Investors should treat it as a 'high risk, high return' bet. Selection methodology:We pick the stock that has shown the maximum increase in consensus analyst rating during the past month. Consensus rating is arrived at by averaging all analyst recommendations after attributing weightages to each of them (5 for strong buy, 4 for buy, 3 for hold, 2 for sell and 1 for strong sell) and any improvement in the rating indicates that the analysts are becoming more bullish on the stock.To ensure that we pick only companies with a decent analyst coverage, this search is restricted tostocksthat have been covered by at least 10 analysts.

Excerpts:ET Now: It was a good move on Monday morning, but since then we have only gone downwards. Do you think this downward momentum continues into next week?Sandeep Wagle: Yes, I think some more downside is in the offing, though I must frankly admit that I did not expect theNiftyto go below 6250. I thought it would take support there and then move up back to 6350-6400, but that has clearly not happened. At a close of 6170, I would talk of a 70 to 80-point downside and I see a range of 6050-6070 on Nifty, which is the next support point and in case that is not held on, then we have to talk of 5950. If that is taken out, then we will talk of the short term trend being in danger or being bearish, but I do not think that will happen. I would first wait and watch for 6070 or 6060, somewhere around that and broadly one thing is for sure, 6250-6280 will be a very difficult level for the Nifty to cross. So I do not see that happening immediately. At lower levels, let us see at what levels it takes support and how much it goes upside.ET Now: What do you do with either the CNX IT or any of the individual large cap IT names?Sandeep Wagle: I would single out Wipro which has closed quite positive. At the current level of Rs 518, I would talk of a move till Rs 540-545. So on any bit of a decline to Rs 510, I would be a buyer. The pattern is quite positive though I am not that impressed with the volume that a weekly closing has impressed me and I very clearly see a 7% to 8% trading upside in the coming week or two.ET Now: Which auto name is looking good for a buy right now?Sandeep Wagle: None of them actually. If you want me to choose between Maruti, M&M; andTata Motors, I would choose Maruti, but then cannot rule out a little bit of correction before the upward move starts. Probably they may consolidate, move sideways with a little bit of downside bias and then start moving up. So, not that gung ho about it. The pattern is not clear, but at lower levels, I would buyMarutito choose from these three.ET Now: Is anything looking interesting to you out of the names like Coromandel International, MRF or for that matter Gujarat Pipavav?Sandeep Wagle: MRF has moved up quite a bit. So I will not be that keen. I would in fact advise booking of profits in this market, you will get it lower. Coromandel looks good. I mean I would be a buyer, were the Nifty to stabilise and move sideways or gives a bounce back from a level of Rs 244. Coromandel would move to somewhere around Rs 265 to Rs 270 and this is a call for the next few weeks. So I would be comfortable taking a call on Coromandel Fertilisers.ET Now: What are your trading ideas?Sandeep Wagle: I would go with a sell in IndiabullsReal Estate, with a stop loss of 68, target of 57. I would go with a sell in aGodrej Industries, stop loss of 270, target of 240 and a buy inAurobindo Pharma, stop loss of 308, target 318.']"

Excerpts:ET Now: Let us start off with individual pockets of news. First isSun Pharma. Johnson & Johnson said in a statement that they will manufactureDoxilnow. What kind of an incremental impact do you think this will have on Sun Pharma?Ranjit Kapadia:Currently Sun Pharma controls almost 100% of the generic Doxil market and with the entry of Johnson & Johnson, its market share is likely to decline, but all depends on regulatory approvals. It will take a couple of months to get those approvals and so after a few months you can see competition taking place in the generic Doxil space.ET Now:Wockhardtis also one stock which has really been outperforming and has been very volatile along withAurobindo Pharma. How do you compare the two and which one would you prefer?Ranjit Kapadia:I will definitely prefer Aurobindo to Wockhardt, because Wockhardt has got a lot of problems regarding regulatory issues for their manufacturing facilities. Only yesterday there was a news that they are listed in Switzerland Stock Exchange and so the stock was up, but the stock has been languishing for quite some time now, whereas in case of Aurobindo, there is a steady flow of news on the launch of their generic products and they are going to do well.Their latest launch has been genericCymbaltathis week and this is going to give a good upside for Aurobindo and at the same time, the rupee has also stabilised. The mark to market losses, which were about Rs 68 crore in the last quarter, are likely to be positive this quarter. So you will see some mark to market gains and this will definitely re-rate the stock, going ahead.ET Now: Ranbaxy also got the first ANDA approval in two years. Given the recent run-up, is this an opportune time to enter the stock?Ranjit Kapadia:It is only for 2.5 mg concentration, whereas for the rest of the concentrations, other players are already there. Therefore, it is not a very major upside for Ranbaxy, but the thing is that sentiments have changed and the company has started getting approvals after a long time. The last approval was one-and-a-half year back for generic Lipitor. After that, they have not got any approvals and now this has started again. Hence, there is a positive view on that front.ET Now: Have you looked at some of the broader market pharma stocks?Neuland Pharmahas been moving around very sharply, or have you looked at any other names, say in the small cap space?Ranjit Kapadia:In small caps, I have looked at Alembic and it looks very positive. It is not under our coverage currently, but Dishman is under our coverage and it also looks very positive. It has sharply moved up almost Rs 50-60 to nearly Rs 98.ET Now: What about some of the other stocks in the midcap space that you would be looking at?Ranjit Kapadia:For the moment, we have Aurobindo, we have Dishman and then we havePfizer.']"

It has had a spectacular move, particularly the recent development on their acquisition in Europe definitely has surprised the market and there is a feeling that, given these developments and a few approvals that they have got, their quarterly numbers are going to surprise the market comprehensively. Still, the stock is available at a substantial discount to some of the larger pharma companies likeSun Pharmaand so on and the momentum can actually take the stock up by another 10% or so.ET Now: So for Aurobindo Pharma, do you think it is pure momentum that is in play? Three months ago, no one liked it, everyone was talking aboutFCCBconcerns, poor management and overseas debt, but now nobody is talking about those factors. In fact, now it is trading at a 50% discount to Sun Pharma and so it should catch up. Why has the demand-supply equation changed?Hemang Jani:Clearly, this stock has had its own set of issues and in the last about four to five months, we have seen a transformation happening. The last two quarters' numbers have been pretty good and because of stability in the rupee, that FCNR-related issues also have actually gone down.Now there is a sense of revival in the business. The management is doing its bit and the stock is available at a discount. So the market is looking out for these kind of ideas and we think that this momentum can actually take the stock higher.ET Now: I do not know if you have got a chance to take a look atHDFC's performance. While the numbers look in line, the problem really is with the stock being so perfectly priced.Hemang Jani:The numbers have been pretty much in line with market expectations. In fact, the bottom line growth does not look that great, given the fact that in the past many quarters, we have seen a growth of more than about 20%, but given the stability factor and the kind of quality that the stock commands, it will remain stable.ET Now: In the last 10 days, the key numbers which have come out, be it from IT companies or banks, have been above estimates. Now the second leg of the earnings season is always reserved for manufacturing companies and PSU banks. So after an initial earnings surprise, are we in for some result disappointment?Hemang Jani:Yes, to some extent what you are right. Even in the past couple of quarters, we have seen a similar trend, with the initial few numbers from IT, pharma and a couple of media stocks being good, but numbers from manufacturing, capital goods and infra and PSU banks are disappointing. However, a good thing this quarter has been that we have seen a mixed trend as far as the PSU banks are concerned.Hence, there might be some positive surprises in certain pockets, particularly in banks likeBank of Barodaand PNB, and a large part of the negativity which we have seen for the last two or three quarters is pretty much known. So the market would look out for some kind of direction from managements, about what they foresee over the next two or three quarters.""]"

So, Arvind would be my best pick out of the three names.ET Now: Just want your views onLupinand beyond that, what is it that you like from the pharma pack?Sandeep Wagle: In the pharma pack over the last few weeks or months, I have been likingAuro Pharmawhich has been consistently performing, but now some other stocks will also move. Lupin at lower levels in the range of Rs 840-850 makes a case for a good buy. I would buy on a correction any other stock. The whole space is looking good, but Auro Pharma is a buy at any level. In that sense, I will be comfortable with that.ET Now: What would be your picks for Monday morning?Sandeep Wagle:Glenmark Pharmais the one that I missed out. This may not move immediately, but take a three-to-four weeks' time horizon. I am much more bullish on the weekly pattern than on the daily or the intraday patterns. At any move towards Rs 550-552 (currently closing at Rs 557- 558), I would be very comfortable buying. I would talk of a longer target in the next two to three months of around Rs 615 to Rs 630, stop loss of Rs 537. The second call is a buy in Arvind.

In a routine quarterly review of FTSE world index, 67 stocks have been added to the index while 23 stocks have been on the exclusion list.Out of the 67 stocks which have been included in the FTSE world index, three stocks are listed on the Indian exchanges. The three Indian stocks which have made their entry on to the list areMotherson Sumi System,Eicher MotorsandAurobindo Pharma.On the contrary,Container Corporation of Indiais the only stock from the Indian markets which has been excluded from the FTSE world index. These changes in the index constituents of FTSE world index will be effective from the closing of September 19.The inclusion of Motherson Sumi alone would lead to a fresh passive inflow of nearly $53 million while Eicher Motors will lead to an inflow of $43 million and Aurobindo Pharma will add $48 million worth of fresh inflows to the Indian equities.Similarly, the exclusion of Container Corporation of India would result in an outflow of funds worth nearly $34 million from the Indian stock markets.Apart from the inclusions and exclusions made on the index constituents, one more change has been made and that is the weightage of some of the Indian stocks constituting the FTSE world index. The index weightage of Idea has been increased.This move would result in an additional flow of nearly $49 million to the Indian equity market. Likewise, Axis Bank's weightage has been reduced and this is expected to lead to an outflow of nearly $58 million from Indian markets.After netting off the passive inflows as well as the outflows made on account of inclusion and exclusions, and also due to the weightage changes, it is expected that these moves will finally result in a net passive inflow of funds worth $100 million into the Indian equities.An inclusion of Indian stocks on the global benchmark index such as FTSE World Index, MSCI Emerging Market Index results in higherFIIinflows, as several of these passive fund managers (usually referred to asETFfunds) link their fund allocation entirely on the basis of the weightage assigned to the stocks by these global indices.So, if any stock is included in the index it would mean a lot of fund managers would automatically start deploying their funds in these stocks, resulting in higher FII holding in that newly added stocks.Since the beginning of 2014, FIIs have poured in funds worth nearly $12.6 billion into Indian equity markets; this helped the Indian markets to be the best performing market among the major global equity markets.According to theSebidata, as of May 15 this year, the total asset under FIIs custody stood at $258 billion ? of which 5% of the money was invested though the ETF route, which includes both India dedicated ETF as well as Global ETF having India allocation.Any increase in the weightage, and inclusion of Indian stocks on any benchmark global indices will lead to an increase in funds allocated to India, hence resulting in fresh inflows of ETF money into the Indian markets.""]"

Excerpts:ET Now: How the CNX IT index may perform?Mitesh Thacker:While the overall set up for the CNX IT index was bearish, it was trading within a range of 10,700-11,500. After the Infosys numbers, the index did make an attempt to get past 11,500, but that was not achieved. Nonetheless, the closing was fairly close to the day's high and that is positive.Traders should typically wait for 11,500 to get breach. If that happens, there is a good chance that 12,000 might be revisited. A lot of buy signals were seen on a couple of IT names, including midcap names such as MindTree andPersistent.Infosys and Tech Mahindra both have showed signals of positive traction on the upside. You might see these stocks gaining 5-6 per cent.ET Now: Can we expect further upside for Hindustan Unilever (HUL)?Mitesh Thacker:We had a trading recommendation on the counter. It has met and the targets of Rs 825 have been breached. It appears to be a rounding continuation formation. It is suggesting a target close to Rs 900. That is a level where some kind of supply or profit booking should emerge.ET Now: Any of the three stocks ? Marico Kaya, Jubilant Life Sciences and Berger Paints -- looking good for trade?Mitesh Thacker:We have tracked Jubilant. It is a stock which has done extremely well and it should be getting past Rs 164-165 levels. The intra-week high was Rs 165, which is also the 200-day average vision.The structure is quite positive and once the breakout happens, traders can look at targets of around Rs 185 level on the upside. I am not tracking Marico Kaya and, therefore, it is difficult for me to comment on it.ET Now: While large cap IT stocks were in limelight, midcap names such as OnMobile, Persistent Systems, Mastek and Hexaware too performed well. Any stock in the midcap IT space that stands out?Mitesh Thacker:Hexaware looks very strong. It appears to have completed a good correction and now is trying to reverse the trend.It appears to have completed a good correction and is looking to reverse the trend. The stock can head towards Rs 225-230 levels in the short term. Once those levels are crossed, then even Rs 250 could be possible. It could be a good stock to accumulate or buy.One may keep a stop loss just below levels of Rs 200. I also like Persistent. This stock never breaks with the short term averages. It is forming a bullish pattern on the intraday charts.The first target should be around the previous highs of Rs 1,880 per piece. There are good chances that we might see levels around Rs 1,950.ET Now: What is that you would be betting on next week?Mitesh Thacker:One is Bata India. It can hit levels around Rs 1,420. Buy it with a stop loss placed at Rs 1,344. Another stock I would like to recommend is Aurobindo Pharma. This stock has hit a fresh high. It has managed to get past levels of Rs 1,165. Buy it with a stop loss placed below Rs 1,150, for the target of Rs 1,225.""]"

""However, the company has taken up the task of addressing the issues and will file the remediation report with the FDA,"" this person said on the condition of anonymity as he is not authorised to speak on the subject.Aurobindo\'s Unit 12 is used mainly to export the US products like tazobactam and piperacilin, an anti-bacterial injection.An email sent to the investor relations representative of the company on Monday for details on the inspection went unanswered. An Aurobindo Pharma spokesperson declined to comment when contacted over the phone.Though no disruption of supply is expected in the short term because of the observations, the FDA is said to have directed the company to furnish detailed plans for correction of the anomalies. The new observations come just two years after the US drug regulator lifted an import ban imposed on one of Aurobindo\'s important manufacturing facilities, named in the industry circles as Unit 6. The FDA had also inspected the Unit 6 facility recently and found that the company had addressed the issues which were ""minor"" in nature, a source said. In the last couple of years, Indian generic drug makers have come under intense scrutiny of the US FDA for non-compliance of good manufacturing practices. Since 2013, the FDA has issued import ban on 22 Indian drug makers, mainly owing to deviations in their manufacturing practices. The US remains an important market for leading Indian generic makers, contributing as much as half their export revenue.For Aurobindo, it is no different. For the quarter ended March 31, 2015, the company reported a net profit of Rs 403 crore on net sales of Rs 3,142 crore, over 50% of which came from US exports. Issues related to manufacturing quality of drugs have dogged the global drug industry alike, cutting across innovators as well as generic makers. A June 2015, a report by Boston Consulting Group focusing on the quality of manufacturing in the biopharma industry and its possible solutions, noted that from 2010 through 2014, 11 of the top 15 biopharmaceutical companies received warning letters from the US FDA. It further added that the manufacturing quality levels in the drug industry remained well below those in other industries, such as semiconductor manufacturing and aerospace.""Such problems can come at a steep price - in some cases hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue, remediation costs that can run in the tens of millions of dollars, and a big hit to the company\'s reputation,"" BCG said in its report.']"

The injectables business is another key trigger for the stock so the management is very-very hopeful of having some 18-20 approvals come through over the next two years. Again, it is a very high margin business. Aurobindo also maintains a very high market leadership positions in the antiretroviral segment. So ARV segment is pretty large and huge again entailing huge margins for the company.In terms of the ANDA pipeline, a very-very strong pipeline, 379 odd drugs in the pipeline, 201 approved so far, so there is a huge pending approval list expected to come through for Aurobindo and our own take is over the next two years, a 12% earningsCAGRtaking the company's top line probably at 11,700-11,800 odd mark and valuations again not looking very-very steep.

Bharat Forge, third on the list with a score of 297, shelled out around Rs 13.2 crore as salary to its CMD B N Kalyani, while Aditya Birla Group company Idea Cellular, which ranked fourth, gave its MD Himanshu Kapania around Rs 6.6 crore.When contacted, Aurobindo Pharma declined to comment. Santrupt Misra, CEO, carbon blackbusiness& director, group HR, Aditya Birla Management Corporation, said: ""Idea is and has been a strong performing company due to a combination of factors such as leadership, strong talent base, performance ethics and clearly focused strategy and meticulous execution."" Misra, however, said the group does not judge leaders only in terms of financial performance but rather with a more comprehensive set of metrics that include qualitative aspects as well such as leadership and talent development, a strong customer and supplier connect and creating value for stakeholders.For FY13-FY15, CEO compensation grew by 25%, while revenues increased by 14.6%, ebitda (earningsbefore interest, tax, depreciation & amortization) margins were flat at 0.3% growth and PAT was up by 12%. Market-cap for the companies grew by 42% while long-term debt on their books increased by 16%.Promoter-owned and run companies had on an average the highest CEO compensation, the study revealed. The average salary paid out to CEOs, for the period, was Rs 6.5 crore. PSUs offered the best return on CEO compensation given the low base of salaries. Nine out of the top 10 companies that offered the best PAT/compensation multiple were PSUs. SBI, Coal India and ONGC were the top 3 companies on that parameter.Harsh Goenka, chairman RPG Enterprises, says ""how much is too much"" is currently engaging boards of many Indian companies. ""Salaries of CEOs have increased exponentially but so has the complexity. A CEO today is not only a leader, but also a strategist, a tactician, a coach, a troubleshooter, a mediator, an innovator and much more. It is impossible to relate CEO salary with just PAT or one particular matrix, but a combination of them,"" he said.However, one top CEO, who did not wish to be identified, said CEO pay is out of whack and more due diligence is required while fixing compensation. ""It needs to be done in a more transparent way. Ideally, by a remuneration committee taking into account similar sized companies in the sector. The gap in the ratio between the common worker and the CEO is huge.""']"

There is talk about you having invested in vaccines. So can you tell me which are the initiatives which may not give you revenues this year or next year but post say 2018-2019 will yield result?N Govindarajan:I will list out what are the ones which you cannot expect revenues over the next two-three years. Vaccine is one, microsphere is one and oncology in terms of larger quantity of products. So while we will start filing, then please understand the fact that approval will take approximately around one-and-a-half to two years.

While its revenue grew 14% year-on-year (y-o-y), net profit grew at a faster rate of 24% y-o-y as its margin profile remained strong. With around 90% of sales coming from the international markets, spread across 150 countries, Aurobindo can be treated as a globalpharmacompany.Just like other Indian pharma companies, a majority of its sales come from the US and Europe. With more than 400 filedANDAs(Abbreviated New Drug Applications) including 228 final approvals, Aurobindo has a strong portfolio in the US. To cater to the US needs, the company also has three manufacturing units there. Analysts feel that Aurobindo will be able to maintain its high growth rates in the US because of its success from the 129 ANDAs filed during the last three years. It is expected to start work on 25 of its approved ANDAs in the coming quarters.The penetration of generic drugs is low in key European countries? France, Spain and Italy?and this provides a good opportunity for Aurobindo. The company also has a focused exposure to some emerging markets such as Brazil, South Africa, Ukraine and Mexico. It also plans to enhance penetration in these markets through local manufacturing units?it already has a plant in Brazil. Aurobindo's margin profile has also been improving over the years, mostly because of the change in its sales mix. For instance, the share of its formulations in revenues increased to 80% in 2015-16 compared to 57% in 2012-13.Since Aurobindo started as an Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients' exporter, there are enough vertical integration (merging business segments) opportunities for its formulations?75% of its raw material need is met in house now. Improving growth momentum in the US is another factor helping its margin profile. Aurobindo is a high-growth pharma company. Between 2012-13 and 2015-16, its revenue and net profit reported a compound annual growth rate of 33% and 89% respectively. According to analysts' consensus estimate, its net profit should show an annualised growth of 22% between 2015-16 and 2017-18. Despite high growth rates, Aurobindo is quoting at a discount to peers.

While its revenue grew 14% year-on-year (y-o-y), net profit grew at a faster rate of 24% y-o-y as its margin profile remained strong. With around 90% of sales coming from the international markets, spread across 150 countries, Aurobindo can be treated as a globalpharmacompany.Just like other Indian pharma companies, a majority of its sales come from the US and Europe. With more than 400 filedANDAs(Abbreviated New Drug Applications) including 228 final approvals, Aurobindo has a strong portfolio in the US. To cater to the US needs, the company also has three manufacturing units there. Analysts feel that Aurobindo will be able to maintain its high growth rates in the US because of its success from the 129 ANDAs filed during the last three years. It is expected to start work on 25 of its approved ANDAs in the coming quarters.The penetration of generic drugs is low in key European countries? France, Spain and Italy?and this provides a good opportunity for Aurobindo. The company also has a focused exposure to some emerging markets such as Brazil, South Africa, Ukraine and Mexico. It also plans to enhance penetration in these markets through local manufacturing units?it already has a plant in Brazil. Aurobindo?s margin profile has also been improving over the years, mostly because of the change in its sales mix. For instance, the share of its formulations in revenues increased to 80% in 2015-16 compared to 57% in 2012-13.Since Aurobindo started as an Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients? exporter, there are enough vertical integration (merging business segments) opportunities for its formulations?75% of its raw material need is met in house now. Improving growth momentum in the US is another factor helping its margin profile. Aurobindo is a high-growth pharma company. Between 2012-13 and 2015-16, its revenue and net profit reported a compound annual growth rate of 33% and 89% respectively. According to analysts? consensus estimate, its net profit should show an annualised growth of 22% between 2015-16 and 2017-18. Despite high growth rates, Aurobindo is quoting at a discount to peers.

It is a very good acquisition, smooth, niche without much of flutter. This will help them to reach their target to be number one in all the market in Europe where they are present. The second point is that it will also help them to further dig into the hospital segment.These kind of companies will help them to increase their volume and without volume you cannot sustain in the European market.

At what level, has the deal been struck and more importantly do you think the balance sheet has that kind of strength to actually absorb this deal?First of all, as far as acquisition is concerned, even if we assume the most pessimistic scenario and consider that they will be doing it through debt, remember, they reduced their debt in last two, three quarters by 150-170 million so in that place ?135 million will come into picture.If you track Granules, what did you make of the news that the Portuguese drug regulator has given 11 observations against it?s Gagillapur facility?My problem with Granules is that I really cannot bet on a company which is betting highly on a highly commoditised product.

In an interview toET Now, Bothra said that sectoral churning is making traders a bit nervous. Edeited Excerpts:ET Now: While the Nift50 has seen range-bound moves, slowly the index has dragged its feet higher towards 10,400 level. What lies in store for investors?Kunal Bothra:This week was marked not just by the Nifty50's good performance but also the underperformance on theBank Nifty.ITstocksdid pretty well, media stocks sprung up into action and metals stocks were more or less consolidating. If the index can rally close to its life time highs, given the fact that some stronger sectors are not performing , it is definitely a good sign. Broadly, Nifty50 has been consolidating in the 300-point 10,100-10,400 band and it seems to be getting over. If the Bank Nifty surprises on the positive side next week, there is a very strong chance that the index may break out of the consolidation phase. The bias still remains bullish. Due to lack of triggers, the action is more stock-specific rather than the indices.ET Now: I want to talk about tea stocks. Do you think that a 20 per cent spike forMcLeod Russelin the week gone by was just a one-off? Do you think that there is a high chance that this up move will continue next week?Kunal Bothra:I think, it should. The stock has done literally nothing since last so many weeks and months. It was trading in a range for the last six-seven months with a slight downward bias. Now what generally springs up many of these stocks which consolidate or stay low for a lot of time is strong volumes and price action.We saw good price action.McLeodRussel closed almost at high point of the day in the last four to five sessions. It saw good price action on good volumes. If you see a follow through into tea names, it could mean a start of a decent upmove. Given the fact that tea stocks have rallied 20-30 per cent in the last one week, it should not worry short term investors because there seems to be a lot of scope on the upside. McLeod has just about broken downward slipping trend line, which has been going on since last two years. This could be just a start of better times to come, especially for McLeod Russel.ET Now: Will some of the index underdogs continue to perform better in coming days? Do you sense that there could be a correction -- may be not now but some time later? Is that at all visible on the technical chart or would you say that is a far-fetched scenario?Kunal Bothra:There are mixed signals. For any correction, we look out for weakness in stocks or sectors which have led the rally. Here, cases in point are metal stocks, housing finance companies and private sector banks. But many of these stocks had already corrected.If you look at chart for a bank likeICICI BankorAxis Bankor evenIndusInd Bank, these stocks had already gone through correction of 7-10 per cent. They are now trying to make a comeback.On the other hand, metals stocks are consolidating. There is no major chart reversal has happened. If I try and look at in terms of sectors or internals of themarkets, it is not throwing any correction warning. A churn is happening which is making traders a bit nervous. One should focus more on stocks and let the index break out of a bigger band of consolidation. Only then, I would expect the next leg of rally to continue.ET Now: What stocks should we bet on Monday morning?Kunal Bothra:I am betting on Dish TV. On Friday, we saw a good price performance coming in for the stock. It came out of a swing resistance-like pattern or bullish flag and got support from the 50-day moving average. Short term traders could look at buyingDish TVat the prevailing of Rs 88-odd level is a and place astop lossat 79.The second stock isAurobindo Pharma. After last week??s price reversal, there seems to be now a short-term bottom in place. The stock has been one of the stronger pharma names since last so many months in terms of price performance. With this retracement towards 200-day moving average happening, the stock should now lead from the front. That is one stock which I am betting on from the pharma pack. Traders can look for a target of Rs 744 on the stock with a stop loss place at Rs 700 level.""]"

But with an astute sense of business from the early days, Reddy's\xa0drive pushed him to do something of his own. Early in his career, a brief association with late Dr. K Anji Reddy, the legendary doyen and founder of Dr. Reddy?s Labs, perhaps\xa0kindled new ideas in the young mind of Ramaprasad Reddy.Dr. Anji Reddy, a scientist to the core, was then\xa0trying to stabilise a fledgling business. His deep knowledge of synthesising drugs with easier and cost-effective techniques helped Ramaprasad Reddy get a fundamental understanding of the sector. Thus, the intrepid explorer and a sworn workaholic, set up his first venture, a trading house for bulk drugs, recalls one of Reddy's former associates, who requested anonymity.For the business to reach a scale, the makings were ripe. With India emerging\xa0as a potential sourcing hub for raw materials or bulk drugs for the US and European multinational companies, which had to align with\xa0stiff environmental regulations and control production overheads, Reddy's unit had a headstart and to keep pace, was his growing ambitions.As demand for low cost active pharmaceutical\xa0ingredients (APIs) firmed up further, a determined Ramaprasad Reddy\xa0sensed an opportunity to move into toll manufacturing of small batches of antibiotic drugs. The expansion\xa0followed, and\xa0in 1986, it was time to give shape to Aurobindo Pharma, along with his long-trusted partner K Nityananda Reddy. From building a single semi-synthetic penicillin manufacturing site, Aurobindo has now expanded its network of manufacturing facilities. At last count, its latest presentation shows 23 facilities of which three are in the US.Vikas DandekarChief Editor|CNBC-TV18Aurobindo Pharma, Intas in race to buy Mallinckrodt's US generic businessQuintiles IMS: 50-70% of chemists in key cities not ready for July 1 GST roll outSwadeshi Jagran Manch writes to PM Modi on drug pricesThe company stands among the most vertically-integrated players in India drawing as much as 70% of its own material for formulations. The distinct advantage is unmistakable. In its latest USFDA approval for the generic versions of Genzyme?s (now Sanofi) Renvela (sevelamer) tablets used to treat end-stage kidney ailments, Aurobindo scored a significant win, while others fell short of crossing the regulatory green signal. Aurobindo?s product filings is said to be from its indigenous facilities and therefore, navigate the technological barriers countered by others in the process of making the APIs.The ride, however, has not been without its share of setbacks. Adverse observations from close monitoring by the USFDA has at times threatened to hobble plans. But the product launches in the US, for most part, have remained on track as the company tightened its quality management systems.Spanning the three decades of its existence, industry executives reminisce, Aurobindo had at one stage nearly caved in to competitive pressures. In the nineties, Aurobindo had a tough choice to make when the Chinese manufacturers virtually took siege of the Indian\xa0market, dumping raw materials at throwaway prices, flattening out scores of Indian manufacturers. In 2002, executives say, Ramaprasad Reddy sensed a looming uncertainty of a\xa0squeeze\xa0out crushed under the sheer scale of Chinese domination. Showing deft, he moved upstream tilting the business model to line up a blitzkreig of filings for formulations in the US. The gambit paid off and\xa0a long runway opened, eventually\xa0moving Aurobindo in the league ofSun Pharma,RanbaxyandDr. Reddy?s. While dozens of\xa0pure-play bulk drug makers were brutally chocked in the rate war with China, Aurobindo saw opportunity in those challenges.?If he trusts you, he firmly backs your decisions. If he does not, he can be tough,? said an industry veteran about Reddy, who worked for the company for nearly a decade. Around the time of his exit, the executive recalls, media speculations were rife about Aurobindo engaging in serious discussions with a large US generic drug-maker. He rubbished those rumours as myth crytpically indicating Aurobindo had more intriguing plans.If true, that grand design reflected Ramaprasad Reddy?s global\xa0ambitions. It was to get a bigger size through a merger or a share swap, a unique construct, that could leapfrog Aurobindo and give it a worldwide footprint. Although that deal never\xa0materialised, the offer, says the executive, was structured to enable a controlling shareholding for the Indian firm. In effect, Aurobindo was close to acquiring the management control of the combined entity, far from being\xa0sold. Ramaprasad Reddy is reticent and has very rarely (if at all) spoken to the media, mirroring industry stalwart and billionaire Dilip Shanghvi, the founder of Sun Pharma.An ex-colleague says Reddy has\xa0no hobbies other than sinking deep in work and passionately plan market strategies. One exceptional moment of triumph for Reddy and his team, the executive recalled, was when at the peak of a global shortage of low-cost drugs for AIDS, Aurobindo trumped Cipla, offering a much lower rate to the MSF, the global aid agency.Shuttling between India and the US, Ramaprasad Reddy may have more aces up his sleeve. The ongoing momentum of product approvals in the US show his company is primed to add heft. Last year, after a fierce bidding war with Intas Pharma to buy select assets of Teva in the UK, Aurobindo took an unexpected step back in the final stages of the deal. People familiar with that transaction say Reddy had second thoughts on the actual benefits of the deal versus a pay out of Rs 5,100 crore. Ramaprasad has struck deals that are typically smaller or bolt-on targets that add to the technological capabilities of the company, results in expansion of the geographical presence and adds to the company?s bottom line in a relatively shorter time.As an executive working in a rival drug firm in Hyderabad puts it, Reddy puts the company ahead of any other considerations. He adds, Reddy never fails to reward his employees, not just in terms of incenntives but also generously doling out stock options down to the lowest rank of colleagues. From a modest family of farmers to now leading a business that exceeds Rs 15,000 crore in revenues, the 58-year old Ramaprasad Reddy is not showing signs of retiring yet. The game is on.""]"

Currently, Aurobindo is among the top 10 generic players in seven European countries namely Portugal, Netherlands, France, Germany, Belgium, Spain and Italy.Aurobindo has shareholder approval to raise Rs 2,100 crore through a sale of shares, which it intends to use for global acquisitions. In addition, the company is spending about Rs 900 crore as part of its capital expansion ? that includes an oral finished dosage facility for European markets in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh.To be sure ?\xa0Aurobindo isn?t limiting itself to acquisitions alone as growth driver ?\xa0the company has charted an organic growth plan that includes preparing to launch 200 new generic drugs including high-margin injectables across Europe in the coming 18-24 months, and most of them are day-one launches based on patent expiration.The drugmaker's 135-million euroacquisitionof Portugal-based Generis Farmaceutica from\xa0PE firm\xa0Magnum Capital Partners is in line with this strategy.The deal helps Aurobindo to consolidate its footprint with 15 percent share in Portugal?s USD 600 million generics market. It also allows Aurobindo further market share gains and margin expansion by leveraging its active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) backend manufacturing and supply chain efficiencies.In a recent statement, Aurobindo said it plans to use the underutilised facility of Generis in Portugal to service the Portuguese market efficiently and also to capture untapped business opportunities in other European countries by participating in short lead-time tenders and low volume products leading to improvement in capacity utilisation from current 50 percent to over 80 percent by 2020.Aurobindo?s string of acquisitions in Europe started in 2006 with the buyout of UK-based Milpharm, followed by its second acquisition of Pharmacin in Netherlands the next year. The company continued its inorganic journey in Europe shopping product portfolios that were put up for sale.Besides, in 2014, the Hyderabad-based pharma company was able to successfully turnaround money-losing Western European commercial operations of Irish drugmaker Actavis Plc, which it bought for 30 million euros.With an economic slowdown and an aging population, many European countries have been trying to cut down healthcare expenditure costs and advocating the\xa0use of low-cost generic drugs over high-cost branded ones. This has opened up huge opportunities for Indian generic drugmakers to exploit.

However, API business declined by 9% due to a higher captive consumption and less priority to low margin tender business.While we believe the integration process will continue to restrict the expansion in operating margins in short term and high level of debts would continue to pose concern for the company, but its focus to get better synergy from the integration, broad-basing the production base and focus on niche segments would help them to achieve stronger earnings growth.hm8485SharekhanHold Persistent Systems; target of Rs 720: SharekhanHold Skipper; target of Rs 287: SharekhanBuy Divis Laboratories; target of Rs 1275: Sharekhan""We have broadly maintained our estimates and price target of Rs 1,272 (implies 16x FY2017E EPS).

But the company surprised many with a performance that beat Street expectations. Owing to the upbeat performance and improving revenue growth visibility, analysts are now upgrading their earnings estimates and target prices for the company.Hitesh Mahida at Fortune Equity Brokers has already upgraded his earnings per share (EPS) estimates for FY14 and FY15 by 36.8 per cent and 23.1 per cent to Rs 30.9 and Rs 37.7, respectively.

Reiterate ?Buy?.? On Friday, the stock closed at Rs 260.5 (up 9.27 per cent) on BSE, after hitting a 52-week high of Rs 264.8, after the announcement of itsresultsfor the quarter ended September. On Monday, the stock touched a year?s high of Rs 274, before closing at Rs 268.45. Given the target prices, there is room for further upside.Sep quarterresultssurpriseRevenues, at Rs 1,914 crore (up 27.6 per cent year-on-year and 11.6 per cent sequentially), were clearly ahead of expectations of Rs 1,811 crore, largely led by robust US formulations sales growth of 72 per cent at Rs 731 crore. A favourable exchange rate, better product mix and consistent improvement in capacity utilisation, after the company resolved the manufacturing issues with US FDA, helped post earnings before interest, tax, deprecation and amortisation of Rs 438 crore and margins of 22.9 per cent; these beat estimates of Rs 325 crore and 17.9 per cent, respectively. While margins improved 622 basis points annually and 497 basis points sequentially, net profit, at Rs 235 crore, was higher than the estimate of Rs 169 crore.US prospects brightenRobust growth in the US is likely to maintain its momentum.', 'The company?s management expects growth in its US business to exceed 20 per cent in dollar terms. Analysts as Mahida believe high growth in the US will continue, as cephalosporin re-launches from unit-VI haven?t reached their potential highs. While the company clocked $4-5 million from cephalosporin sales in the September quarter and $8 million in first half of FY14, it expects to record $25 million in sales from the cephalosporin portfolio in FY14.Growth in the US is likely to be further driven by the injectables portfolio. After the USFDAapproval for unit-IV (specialised injectables-producing site), moreANDAapprovals are expected. The company is expected to launch three injectables in the next 30-45 days, and these will address a cumulative market size of $68-80 million. Notably, all these three products are seeing a shortage in the US. While Aurobindo expects its injectable filings to cross the 100-mark in the next six months, against the current 43, analysts estimate injectable sales at $33 million and $45-50 million in FY14 and FY15, respectively. Reports suggest while the current monthly run for injectables from unit-IV is about $3 million, it may stand at $8-10 million in the next six-eight quarters. The company has invested around Rs 300 crore in unit-IV and has 36 injectable ANDAs pending approvals.On a strong footingThe company?s chief executive, Arvind Vasudeva, said their European business had turned profitable in the UK, Germany, Spain and The Netherlands. The Portugal business, however, wasn?t profitable yet, though it was growing at a good pace. Operations in Italy, however, would take time to break even.At Rs 405 crore, domestic sales grew just 7.9 per cent year-on-year during the quarter.

In addition to a one-time gain on account of Cymbalta, sales in the US which grew 84 per cent to Rs 931 crore was higher on account of new launches as well as market share gain in the injectibles business.While the company plans to maintain its sales volumes forCymbaltawhich has a market size of $5 billion, growth in the US is also likely to come from Aurolife which is into controlled substances segment and auromedics, whichmarketsinjectables products in that market.Ashish Rathi and Krishnanath Munde ofEmkay GlobalFinancial Services expect Aurobindo's core US business to grow at an annual rate of 20 per cent in FY14-16 driven by niche product launches and injectable business. They also expect improvement in the core business margin. The consolidation of the European business and its turnaround, according to the them will be the key deciding factor for the stock going ahead."", ""While net debt of Rs 3,394 crore at the end of December 2013 will continue to be a concern, analysts atSharekhansay that healthy cash-flows (over Rs 1,100 crore) generated during nine months of FY14 is comforting and will help to significantly reduce the short-term debts. This also helps to mitigate the strain due to the acquisition of the businesses of Actavis in seven European countries. At the current price of Rs 501, the stock is trading at 11 times its FY15 earnings per share estimate of Rs 45.Strong US pipeline, European integration keyThe company has 308 abbreviated new drug approval (ANDA) filings which includes 18 injectable and seven control substances. These products have a better margin profile than other generic drugs.Given the boost to revenues from the launch of new drugs and better margins the Street will keep an eye out on new launches, with the company expecting about six approvals for its products from the US regulatory agency over the next six months.Themarketswill also look at development in the European operations where recently the company acquired Actavis' commercial infrastructure in key Europeanmarketsfor 30 million euros. The European business coupled with rest of the worldmarketsgrew 27 per cent year-on-year in the quarter to about Rs 284 crore.Sharekhananalysts believe the acquisition will put a short-term pressure on the margin as the business is currently incurring a loss at the operating level and the company is bound by the agreement to take supplies from Actavis for certain products.""]"

The Street was worried about the price erosion in anti-depressant drug duloxetine (the generic version of Eli Lilly's multi-billion dollar brand cymbalta) and integration-related challenges of Actavis, the company it acquired earlier in the year. The company managed to post operating profit margins at 22.11 per cent, beating consensus analyst expectations of 20.5 per cent.While competitive pressures remain, the beat on margins has come on the back of growth in its injectable portfolio and traction in the rest of the world business. Overall product mix also improved, with lower contribution of anti-retroviral or HIV drugs, which being tender-led fetch lower margins. Injectable business under its subsidiary Auromedics grew 119 per cent to around $17 million (Rs 104 crore) during the quarter, while its controlled substances and non-institutional business under subsidiary Aurolife also grew at a healthy clip.The US revenues, which contribute more than half of formulation revenues and 40 per cent to overall revenue, grew 60 per cent year-on-year, while rest of the world business which accounts for seven per cent of formulation revenues grew 90 per cent."", ""Analysts at Nomura feel the loss in duloxetine revenue was made up to an extent by a pick-up in the sale of amphetamine salt, a nervous system stimulant and anti-bacterial suspension sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim.The company's operating profit at Rs 637 crore came much higher than consensus estimate of Rs 598 crore. It is the higher growth at the operating level which helped the company post a 58.3 per cent rise in net profit to Rs 372 crore which was in line with estimates. The robust net profit number came in despite higher taxes (Rs 100 crore more than year ago quarter) and forex loss of Rs 42 crore.The injectable range is expected to continue driving growth on the back of high-value product approvals coupled with traction in the controlled substances portfolio. The oncology portfolio over the next few years could also prove to be money spinner. Ranjit Kapadia at Centrum Broking feels that the stock has been re-rated in recent months due to improved performance in the US and higher valuation of the pharma sector as growth momentum is expected to continue in the future. Kapadia feels the margins at 22-23 per cent will be sustainable over the coming quarters and the company reiterated this point in a post-resultsinvestor concall.""]"

The correction was due to some disappointment on the margin front in the December 2014 quarter, US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) inspections at its manufacturing units and also the proposed QIB worth $350 million that would have led to some equity dilution, say analysts.Aurobindo has a strong niche product portfolio in the US market, comprising injectables, oral contraceptives, peptides and ophthalmic products.Analysts at HSBC, in their February note, had said that in the near-term controlled-substances (under AuroLife), high value oral solids, triple combination HIV products and nutraceuticals will drive the company's US business. The filing rate is aggressive (78 ANDAs filed in FY14), which has led to the company having the largest number of pending ANDAs (181) in the US.While new product approvals in the US are margin drivers, Aurobindo is now also selectively bidding for better-margin in tenders of anti-retroviral drugs (HIV treatment).According to IMS data, Aurobindo?s trailing three months (T3M) US sales in January'15 marked a growth of three per cent over T3M sales in December 2014. This was the third highest growth after Dr Reddy?s four per cent and Cadila?s eight per cent growth. Analysts at Nomura say that T3M sales of anti-hypertensive Diovan generic increased 55 per cent.Europe is also likely to become a growth driver post acquisition of Dublin-based Actavis Plc?s commercial operations in Europe.Analysts at Citi say Aurobindo has rationalised the product basket, integrated front ends and gained volumes in its own portfolio."", ""Annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amoritisation losses are set to come down from ?20 million (when acquired) to ?10 million in FY15, and likely to break-even in FY16. Aurobindo is setting up a plant in Vizag to cater to Europe. Supplies should start in FY17 and drive margins to peak levels of 14-15 per cent.Analysts at HSBC had said the Ebitda margin in first half of FY15 was 22 per cent, well ahead of the average of 18 per cent for FY09-13; which they feel is sustainable and expect return on invested capital (ROIC) to improve to 23.7 per cent by FY17 from 20 per cent in FY15. An improvement in free cash flow should also help to reduce leverage. The QIB, if approved, will further reduce net debt/equity to sub-0.5x levels, believe analysts at HSBC. While analysts as Ranjit Kapadia at Centrum Broking have target price of Rs 1,380, HSBC's have a target price of Rs 1,586 and those most bullish as Citi have target price of Rs 1,945.""]"
