He started with stationery and stockings, but went on to build one of the world?s biggest furniturecompanies.And the way he did it has revolutionised how retailers operate.', 'There are two facets of modern life that we haveIkeato thank for: flat-pack furniture and ashop layoutthat gets you buying more of its products than you initially intended to. Both are principles that a number of othercompanieshave put to good use.', 'Ikeafirst brought out its now signature style of flat-pack furniture in the 1950s. Whether you love or loathe this concept, it was astroke of geniusand a effective way of making the masses value the brand. There are theobvious aspectsof cost efficiency and the practicality of shipping. But flat-pack furniture also has an important subconscious influence on consumers.', 'WhenIkeamade the switch away from selling furniture that was already assembled, it was most likely unaware of how it would influence its consumers. Yet scientists have since managed to pinpoint why consumers simply can?t get enough of building their own furniture. The simple act of touching products (and what better way to ensure touch based interaction than through assembling a piece of furniture) can increase youroverall perceived valueof the product. Couple this with the fact that the more effort a consumer has to put into building something the more they like it ? you have an undoubtedly winning formula.', 'Tests have shownthat the actual act of putting something together (even though there may be sweat, swearing and tears involved) so that it becomes a complete object generates a much more favourable perception of that object than it would purchasing it in a completed form. The phenomenon is known asthe Ikea effect.', 'This effect is further enhanced by the fact that touch itself isneurologically coupled with emotion.', 'This means that when we touch something the emotive part of our brain is activated so that we experience a close connection with the product. Touch creates feelings of ownership and increases the perceived value we have of items. Thus the happy assembler of the flat pack will, once finished, feel proud of their achievement and experiencing feelings of being closely connected to the item.', 'Round and round in circles', 'The layout of theIkeastores has also paved the way for a more creative way of thinking about how to guide shoppers. If you have ever visited one of its huge warehouse stores, you may have gone in thinking you were only buying a few items, to find yourself coming out of the store with a trolley full of things. This is because of its circular design and one way system.', 'This design means you often can?t see what is coming next and fear you?ll miss something you need if you don?t continue all the way along the path. There are potential escape points throughout the store, but that would mean that you will miss several of the sections and rarely consumers are prepared to take that risk.', 'Because you know it may be tricky to revisit a particular item later on, you are inclined to pick it up when you see it and put it in your big trolley. This ensures that the customer touches the product, which in turn againgenerates a psychological sense of ownership over itand decreases the likelihood that it will be put down en route to the tills.', 'The fact that you can?t see around the next corner also creates a subconscious sense of mystery,which draws the customer gradually further into the store. Environments perceived to be mysterious usually generate an overall stronger liking and so encourage shoppers to keep walking through the store. And the more you do this, the more likely you are to buy something ? especially all the smaller items on display such as candles, napkins and picture frames as they seem cheap compared to the larger more expensive items.', 'Ikea?s creative ability to tap into the unconsciousness of consumers is undoubtedly a big part of its success ? and also why it?s beencopiedby many othercompanies.Even thoughIngvar Kampradis no longer with us,Ikeahas inherited from him an ethos of thinking outside of the box to communicate with consumers.

Bhatia told Business Standard.However, this is not the first time that a company has come out with a mobile phone for dirt cheap. How can one forget the euphoria around Freedom 251, which was touted as the world?s cheapest smartphone in 2016? Many believed it was impossible to sell a smartphone for Rs 251 and the belief indeed turned out to be true as the company Ringing Bells failed to deliver the devices after getting orders for millions of phones through online bookings. The company only provided a few thousand devices to consumers.However, Bhatia feels that theFreedom 251was possibly the most-hyped product in recent years and it turned out to be a disappointment as the company failed to deliver its promise. ?We are here to change the perception?We are trying to bring communication services in the most cost-effective manner, with a clear target to address the untapped section, who still feels that owning a phone is a luxury,? he added.Asked if the company is able to make money by selling a phone for Rs 299, Bhatia said they are at a break-even situation for the product but the company makes reasonable margins on other products. The price range of otherDetelmobile phones is Rs 349 to Rs 899. The company recently tied up with BSNL for voice and data offers with its feature-phones.', 'As part of the deal, aDetelD1 mobile along with a BSNL connection can be bought for Rs 499, which comes with a validity of 365 days and a talk time of Rs 103.

This is less than 2 per cent of the total 51.6 lakh women thegovernmentseeks to benefit annually.As a result, in the next fiscal, thegovernmentwill have to provide cash benefits to double the number of women, while last yearsbudgetwould have lapsed.This shows that thegovernmentis not serious, said Dipa Sinha, convenor of the Right to Food campaign, who was among those who wrote to Jaitley.""By the government\'s own truncated estimate, 52 lakh women were to benefit from the scheme in the current financial year. But since only a fraction of them have received the cash transfer, it means thegovernmentneeds to now reach out to double the annual estimate in the next financial year and, therefore, should have at least sought twice the funds allocated last year,"" Sinha explained.She added that the scheme is violative of the NFSA, under which all pregnant and lactating mothers, exceptgovernmentemployees, are entitled to a sum of at least Rs 6,000.The PMMVY programme is, however, restricted to only one child per woman. The scheme also excludes any woman who already has a child today because it applies only to the birth of the first living child.Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a televised New Year Eve address to the nation on December 31, 2016 announced the pan-India expansion of the maternity benefit scheme which was until then being implemented across 56 districts as part of a pilot project.In May 2017, the Union Cabinet approved thePradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojanafor pregnant women and lactating mothers, effective from January 1, 2017.Under the scheme, a woman would receive Rs 5,000 in three instalments upon meeting different requirements and remaining Rs 1,000 under Janani Suraksha Yojana after institutional delivery.According to Sinha, by adding conditionalities such as institutional delivery for women to claim Rs 1,000 of the total Rs 6,000, thegovernmentis denying mothers their right under law.Maternity benefits became a legal entitlement in 2013 under the NFSA, which states, ""Subject to such schemes as may be framed by the central government, every pregnant and lactating mother shall be entitled to [nutritious food and] maternity benefit of not less than rupees six thousand, in such instalments as may be prescribed by the centralgovernment.']",/budget/article/budget-2018-govt-may-sidestep-demand-for-boost-to-maternity-benefit-scheme-118012900894_1.html

Be careful what you ask, Maria.When actressSonam Kapoorappeared on the cover ofElle Indiawearing a piece from Dior?s latest collection, this is why I was angry.In 2006, spurred on by requests for work from the women in the village where I live ? Mandi Gaon ? I started a tiny non-profit called The Knitwits. We created knitwear which I helped design, delivering materials to the houses of women who often weren?t able or allowed to leave, and later collecting finished pieces. But I had made a crucial mistake ? I had no buyer.These were the pre-Instagram, Facebook Store days and I began to wonder if I would have to go stand around at local crafts markets, when someone suggestedPeople Tree.I?d long been a fan of their t-shirts so made my way to the store to check if they were interested.I was led up a red ladder to an office crammed with books, baubles and crafts tools where Gurpreet Sidhu gave me my first business lesson. She took a good look at the knitwear I had carried, suggested what changes I could make in the next round, asked me how much I planned to pay the women, priced it fairly and asked one of her girls to put the scarves and hats in store.Nothing about the wayPeople Treeworks has changed. Not since 1990, when Sidhu and her husband Orijit Sen opened with a simple line of t-shirts. The philosophy?s always been the same: create original, beautiful, earth-friendly goods that tell a story, and help as many as you can in the process.Sidhu and Sen gave jobs to those in need, let their house be used as a centre of the arts, for blockprinting sessions, for refugees. They managed somehow to balance doing what businesses never do ? making a profit and making a difference. With a store a stone?s throw away from Jantar Mantar, they?ve always been witness to and actively involved in calls for justice over the years, becoming over time a haven for those straying from the mainstream, in fashion, politics or society.Which is why we were shocked to seeSonam Kapooron cover of the magazine in a dress from Dior?s Spring/Summer 2018 Ready To Wear Cruise Line, which looked exactly like it had been crafted byPeople Tree.The two garments, posted in the format below onto social media by Sen and Sidhu?s daughter Pakhi Sen, created a stir I doubt Dior quite thought was possible.In the initial backlash Pakhi Sen received from Dior fans, people went as far as to say the two fabrics looked nothing alike. This was when many like myself felt compelled to speak up. The similarities between the prints Dior print and thePeople Treeone are by no means minor:The colour ? the exact same rust red.Yoga pose 1 ? Padmasana.Yoga pose 2 ? Natarajasana.The flower ? whilePeople Treealternated the yoga poses with a lotus, Dior chose to use a tulip.The style of art.Sen, the original designer of the print, has since shared images of the first drawings and blocks made for it, dug up 15 years after he first created them.By no stretch of the imagination could this be a mere coincidence, as many on the internet insisted.More than Dior, it was celebrities who had posted wearing the dress, such as supermodel and TV host Alexa Chung, who came under fire. (Chung has since deleted the image off her Instagram, but here are images of her wearing the dress to the Dior Ball and show, where she had a front row seat.)Elle Indiaand their January cover modelSonam Kapoorreceived flak as well. This is where it gets complicated.Neither Chung, Kapoor norElle Magazineare at fault here. As an actress who is most likely advised by a team of sponsors and stylists (including her sister Rhea Kapoor) Kapoor may not have had much say in her outfit. Even if she had, let?s say she simply chose the one that looked good on her. Simple. What?s not so simple has been her silence on the issue since then. In an attempt to keep the big design house happy, Kapoor has kept mum about it.This, to many who follow and love her, is a real shame. Kapoor is better known for her impeccable dress choices and for promoting new indigenous designers than she is for her films. She?s frequently given unknown designers a foothold to reach out and touch the stars. For her not to say something, not to apologise for not knowing, or acknowledge the existence of People Tree, was heartbreaking.Some said thatPeople Treehad jumped the gun by using the Elle cover image, and they should have used a runway or stock image of the dress rather than drag the magazine into the mess. Here is how the two garments bearing the print appeared on the runway and on the Dior website now.It would have been impossible to make a point using these images. As a result,Elle Indiatook the heat. I repeat, Elle isn?t at fault. It?s disappointing that its fashion team did not know of People Tree?s design (both companies function out of Delhi), but it isn?t a crime.It does though beg the question ? how many times hasElle Indiafeatured garments from People Tree, an almost 30-year-old Indian design store making an impact, in the pages of their magazine? Is all fashion representation in magazines sponsored by design houses with astronomically priced wares? Where does Elle draw the line between what is truly fashionable, original and making an impact, and what they are paid to feature?Those are questions for another day. The question today is ? how on Earth did this happen?Christian Dior?s current creative director, Maria Grazia Chiuri is best known for launching her role at the design house by sending models down the ramp in t-shirts bearing the title of an essay by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie: ?We Should All be Feminists?.While the T-shirts still shine bright in our memories, what has been quietly brushed under the carpet is that many of the pieces from the collection came under the radar for being exact replicas of traditional Romanian folk costumes.Is Chiuri to blame? The answer is complicated. Fashion houses like Dior don?t often have one single designer at the helm. Creative Director she may be, but the actual designing, print sourcing, and ideating is done by a team, sometimes made up of young designers under pressure to churn out original work that has the potential to become the next craze.Imagine for a moment one of these young designers. She has her dream job working under Chiuri at Dior, but the team is ideating for the Spring-Summer 2018 Collection and she?s tired and frankly has nothing to offer at the next day?s meeting. That evening she goes to a party in Manhattan?s Lower East Side. A girl walks in wearing a smashing dress in autumnal red, printed with what looks like poses from her yoga class.The designer walks up to her and compliments the dress. ?Oh thank you! Believe it or not, I bought it years ago at this cute little store in India!?Dior girl asks to take a photograph of it.', 'The next day at the meeting she hands it in. It?s approved. It could have been that simple. Chiuri may not have been the one to find the print or copy it ? I?d hope the person occupying the position once held by Yves Saint Laurent, Gianfranco Ferre and John Galliano knows better. But she should have better checks in place.']",/article/current-affairs/dior-s-dirty-laundry-how-a-bn-dollar-firm-failed-to-give-credit-yet-again-118013100204_1.html

This occurs every 29.5 days, when the moon is directly opposite the sun relative to the Earth. Jan. 31 will be ournext full moon in the lunar cycle.', 'What?s alunar eclipse?', 'The moon?s orbit is tilted by about 5 degrees relative to the Earth?s orbit. So, most of the time the moon ends up a little above or below the path Earth follows as it revolves around the sun. But twice in each lunar cycle, the moon doescross into our planet?s orbital plane.', 'If that crossing corresponds to a full moon, the moon will pass into the Earth?s shadow, resulting ina total lunar eclipse. Since the moon needs to be behind the Earth, relative to the sun, alunar eclipsecan only happen on a full moon.', 'To see the phenomenon, you need to be on the night side of the Earth;this eclipse will be visible mostlyin Asia, Australia, the Pacific and North America. But don?t worry if you miss it, lunar eclipses happen on average a couple times a year. The next one visible in North Americawill be on Jan. 21, 2019.', 'Ablue moonthat looks red', 'When alunar eclipsehappens, the moon appears to darken as it moves into the Earth?s shadow called the umbra. When the moon is all the way in shadow it doesn?t go completely dark; instead, it looks red due to aprocess called Rayleigh scattering. The gas molecules of Earth?s atmosphere scatter bluer wavelengths of light from the sun, while redder wavelengths pass straight through.', 'This is why we haveblue skies and red sunrises and sunsets.', 'When the sun is high in the sky, red light passes straight through to the ground while blue light is scattered in every direction, making it more likely to hit your eye when you look around.During a sunset, the angle of the sun is lower in the sky and that red light instead passes directly into your eyes while the blue light is scattered away from your line of sight.', 'In the case of a lunar eclipse, the sunlight that makes it around Earth passes through our atmosphere and is refracted toward the moon. Blue light is filtered out, leaving the moonlooking reddish during an eclipse.', 'On top of it all, the Jan. 31 full moon is also a considered ablue moon.There are two different definitions ofblue moon.The first is any time a second full moon occurs in a single month. Since there are 29.5 days between two full moons, we usually only end up with one per month. With most months longer than 29.5 days, it occasionally works out that we have two full moons. We already had one on the first of this month and our second will be Jan. 31, making it ablue moon.With this definition our nextblue moonis in March, leaving February with no full moon this year.', 'The second definition of ablue moonstates it?s thethird moon in a seasonin which there are four moons, whichhappens about every 2.7 years. We?ll only have three this winter, so the Jan. 31 full moon won?t be blue by this definition. Stargazers will need to wait until May 18, 2019, for ablue moonthat fits this older, original definition.', 'A supersized supermoon', 'Finally, to add the cherry on top, this will alsobe a supermoon. The moon?s orbit is not perfectly circular, meaning its distance from Earth varies as it goes through one cycle. The closest point in its orbit is called the perigee. A full moon that happens near perigee iscalled a supermoonby some.', 'This happened with our full moon earlier this month on Jan. 1 and will again on Jan. 31.', 'Its proximity makes it seem a little bit bigger and brighter than usual, but that?s the extent of its effects on Earth. The distinction is usually hard to notice unless you?re looking at two pictures side by side.', '', 'There are long traditions of givingdifferent moons names. This being a bigger, brighter, reddish-looking blue moon, perhaps we should call the next full moon the super purple moon.

Everyone, be warned.The government cautions that theDay Zerothreat will surpass anything a major city has faced since World War II or the Sept. 11 attacks. Talks are underway with South Africa?s police because ?normal policing will be entirely inadequate.? Residents, their nerves increasingly frayed, speak in whispers of impending chaos.The reason for the alarm is simple: The city?s water supply is dangerously close to running dry.If water levels keep falling,Cape Townwill declareDay Zeroin less than three months. Taps in homes and businesses will be turned off until the rains come. The city?s four million residents will have to line up for water rations at 200 collection points. The city is bracing for the impact on public health and social order.?WhenDay Zerocomes, they?ll have to call in the army,? said Phaldie Ranqueste, who was filling his white SUV with big containers of water at a natural spring where people waited in a long, anxious line.It wasn?t supposed to turn out this way forCape Town.This city is known for its strong environmental policies, including its careful management of water in an increasingly dry corner of the world.But after a three-year drought, considered the worst in over a century, South African officials sayCape Townis now at serious risk of becoming one of the few major cities in the world to lose piped water to homes and most businesses.Hospitals, schools and other vital institutions will still get water, officials say, but the scale of the shut-off will be severe.Cape Town?s problems embody one of the big dangers of climate change: the growing risk of powerful, recurrent droughts. In Africa, a continent particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, those problems serve as a potent warning to other governments, which typically don?t have this city?s resources and have done little to adapt.For now, political leaders here talk of coming together to ?defeatDay Zero.? As water levels in the dams supplying the city continue to drop, the city is scrambling to finishdesalinationplants and increase groundwater production. Starting in February, residents will face harsher fines if they exceed their new daily limit, which will go down to 50 liters (13.2 gallons) a day per person from 87 liters now.Just a couple of years ago, the situation could not have looked more different here. In 2014, the dams stood full after years of good rain. The following year, C40, a collection of cities focused on climate change worldwide, awardedCape Townits ?adaptation implementation? prize for its management of water.Cape Townwas described as one of the world?s top ?green? cities, and the Democratic Alliance ? the opposition party that has controlledCape Townsince 2006 ? took pride in its emphasis on sustainability and the environment.The accolades recognised the city?s success in conserving water. Though the city?s population had swelled by 30 percent since the early 2000s, overall water consumption had remained flat. Many of the new arrivals settled in the city?s poor areas, which consume less water, and actually helped bring down per capita use.The city?s water conservation measures ? fixing leaks and old pipes; installing meters and adjusting tariffs ? had a powerful impact. Maybe too powerful.The city conserved so much water that it postponed looking for new sources.For years,Cape Townhad been warned that it needed to increase and diversify its water supply. Almost all of its water still comes from six dams dependent on rainfall, a risky situation in an arid region with a changing climate.', 'The dams, which were full only a few years ago, are now down to about 26 percent of capacity, officials say.']",/article/international/dangerously-low-on-water-cape-town-to-face-day-zero-within-months-118013100182_1.html

While his impromptu tweets and remarks are more prone to be inaccurate or unfounded, the president?s prepared speeches tend to be more tempered, even if they have taken facts out of context, included overstated or undue self-praise or offered bleak and exaggerated diagnoses.Here are some lessons and themes drawn from a year of fact-checking Trump?s public remarks, interviews and social media posts as president.Policy achievementsTrump has been unable to fulfill one of his central campaign pledges ? repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act ? but it hasn?t stopped him from falsely declaring otherwise. In some remarks, Trump has been accurate, describing the end of the health care law?s individual mandate as ?partial repeal.? Virtually all other parts of the law remain intact.It is also not accurate for Trump to claim full credit for the collapse of the Islamic State?s self-proclaimed caliphate in Syria and Iraq. A significant amount of territory has been recaptured and major battles have been won in the last year, but Trump has largely overseen a strategy started under President Barack Obama.The $1.5 trillion tax cut signed by Trump in December is his first major legislative achievement in office. But he is wrong to characterize it ? as he has done at least four times this year ? as the largest in history (at least three are bigger) or the first since President Ronald Reagan?s 1981 tax cut (most presidents since Reagan have cut taxes).The ?Trump bump? in the economyTrump is likely to boast about a roaring American economy and healthy job growth, though his claims should be viewed in context.He has, for example, boasted at least seven times in the past two weeks that the black unemployment rate, 6.8 percent in December, is the lowest ever recorded. While true, it is the culmination of a longer-term trend. It is also an open question how much credit a president, especially in his first year, can take for the economy.The same can be said of Trump?s repeated claim that nearly 2.4 million jobs have been added since his election in November 2016. The number is accurate, but appears less groundbreaking with the appropriate context: More jobs were added in the 14 months before his election than in the 14 months since.Trump has also misrepresented the tax cut?s effect on the decisions of American businesses.Contrary to his claims that Chrysler is ?leaving Mexico and coming back to the United States,? the automaker continues to operate several plants in Mexico even as it shifts production of some pickup trucks to Michigan. Similarly, he has trumpeted Apple?s announcement of a $350 billion, five-year investment as a boon for manufacturing, but the company was already on track to spend $275 billion over the next five years.InternationaldealsTrump often talks up his deal-making prowess.', 'But he has taken credit for agreements that were drawn up before he was involved or relies on fuzzy math to promote the most impressive dollar figure possible.']",/article/international/state-of-the-union-how-truthful-was-trump-in-his-first-year-as-president-118013100146_1.html

The director of the White House National Economic Council, Gary Cohn, said on Fox News before Trump?s speech that the 3 million figure includes ?some type of tax bonus or wage increase or pension increase? awarded to workers.Cohn said more than 350 companies have made ?announcements in direct reflection of what we?ve done with taxes.?Trump?s speech is to feature bipartisan pitches on subjects including infrastructure and immigration. Guests seated in the First Lady?s box at the speech include victims of gang violence and law enforcement officers wounded in the line of duty. The decision to highlight areas for possible cooperation across the aisle and to frame the president?s remarks around stories of exceptional Americans is a tacit admission that Trump is addressing a Congress and a country sharply divided by the opening year of his administration.Softer ToneControversy over the probe into his campaign?s possible collusion with Russia has been heightened in recent days by his administration?s decision to largely avoid imposing new sanctions on Russia and a bid by congressionalRepublicansto release a memo in which they allege improper behavior by FBI leadership investigating the president.Trump planned to steer clear of those controversies in his speech, said a person familiar with the text. He will instead devote his remarks to the idea that an improving economy has helped all Americans. Central to that argument is a celebration of the tax cuts, passed byRepublicanstoward the end of last year, and a promise to crackdown on what Trump considers to be unfair trade arrangements.?America has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs and our nation?s wealth,? he will say.In striking a softer tone, the White House hopes to win back voters who appear to be abandoning the president and his party ahead of upcoming midterm elections, according to polls.', 'Trump also seeks to encourage lawmakers in the throes of an immigration policy debate and still smarting from a dispute that led to a brief government shutdown to consider Trump?s policy priorities.']",/article/international/donald-trump-speech-we-have-arrived-at-new-american-moment-of-prosperity-118013100123_1.html

Here are our observations:Samsung MallTheGalaxy On7 Primeis the first smartphone to feature the Samsung Mall app, which promises to enhance users? shopping experience by making product search easier. However, in real-life scenario, the app has its hits and misses.The Mall feature works through a dedicated app or camera interface. To make a search, you need to click a photo of the product and the mall app would make an online search for it across e-commerce platforms to look for products matching the photograph. The app shows close results and compares the prices, too. But the result is not always correct; sometimes it shows irrelevant results.DesignFor a smartphone with a 5.5-inch screen, the Galaxy On7 comes across as huge and with its share of avoidable design flaws. The front is dominated by a 16:9 aspect ratio screen, which leaves huge bezels on the top and bottom. The fingerprint scanner is placed under the home button at the bottom of the screen, along with capacitive option and back key, to utilise the bottom bezel.The back looks old-school with a three-piece bland design, which uses metal at the centre and plastic blocks on the top and bottom. The power button is placed on the right side, along with a mono speaker right above it.', 'Volume rocker keys, SIM card slots and the microSD card slot are on the left side.DisplayThe smartphone?s 5.5-inch fullHD (1920 x 1080) 16:9 aspect ratio screen works optimally. The touch is responsive and the display renders good contrast and saturation. However, the sunlight legibility, viewing angles and peak brightness levels are not very impressive, considering that the screen is from the TFT breed.CameraAs for imaging capabilities, the On7 Prime has a 13-megapixel shooter with a bright f/1.9 aperture on the rear and front. The rear camera offers satisfactory image quality but the interface leaves you a little confused sometimes. The photographs come out sharp, with satisfactory details in good-light scenarios, and the low-light performance is on par with other budget smartphones.The selfie camera, on the other hand, is a capable one. With face detection enabled, the front camera focuses quickly and takes detailed shots.PerformanceThe On7 Prime hosts the Exynos 7870 octa-core processor, developed in-house by Samsung and offering enough power to manage and run tasks smoothly. However, the power-intensive apps like Asphalt 8 take a toll on the computing prowess and the processor shows some signs of weakness.The device boots the Android Nougat 7.1 covered under the Samsung user interface preloaded with some bloatware and apps. The interface is mostly clean but far from perfect.BatteryThe phone?s 3,350 mAh battery keeps the show running for more than a day, even on operating processor-intensive tasks like gaming, video streaming and music playback.

Various research studies, including those byNational Institute of Public Finance & Policy(NIPFP) and also the White Paper onBlack Moneytabled in theLok Sabhaon 21 May 2012, have repeatedly pointed to the vicious link betweenreal estatesector and the black economy in India.Containing black economy is a stated public policy objective, which the State strives to achieve, as it is eating into the vitals of the socio-economic & political fibre of the country. Poor governance (resulting from corruption) increases costs. Therefore, it becomes imperative for the government to bring in comprehensive reforms inreal estateto make the campaign againstblack moneysuccessful.It is hard to value real estate, which makes it suited for undervaluation and an ideal investment for black savings. Understating of the value of immovable properties in the transfer deed is a major way of generating black income. The difference between the market value and the declared value of properties at the time of registration gives the extent of under-reported income.The current regime of taxation on land andreal estateincentivises widespread tax evasion, and generation and use ofblack money.At present, there is a plethora of taxes levied by different authorities on land andreal estate(See Table: Important taxes & charges on land &real estatepost 1 July 2017) which leads to cascading of taxes thereby increasing the distortionary impact of taxes on efficiency and productivity of thereal estatemarket.The present regime of transfer, registration and stamp duties, all being transaction-centric taxes, are amenable to inclusion within theGSTbase asGSTis also a transactions tax. Inclusion ofreal estatewithin theGSTfold will help in minimising the overall tax burden in absolute rupee terms."", 'This will, in turn, enhance the elasticity and buoyancy of India?s indirect tax system, because the audit trail inGSTwill bring a greater proportion ofreal estatetransactions into the tax net, augmenting the revenue collection.GSTleaves a digital trail of transactions, which becomes a disincentive and deterrent for non-reporting or under-reporting of the sale value of the land or building, and thereby reduces the shadow economy.']",/article/economy-policy/real-estate-under-gst-a-great-weapon-in-the-war-against-black-money-118013100580_1.html

Simultaneous polls will also ensure that development work is not stopped every few months because of the imposition of the model code of conduct.Why then is the Opposition opposed to the move?For starters, not just the Opposition but several other constitutional experts, have pointed out practical problems in implementing ?one nation one poll?.Secondly, the Opposition is deeply suspicious of the PM?s intent in pushing for simultaneous polls. It believes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is set to lose assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, which are due in December. This will weaken its momentum going into the Lok Sabha polls that are scheduled to take place in April-May 2019. However, simultaneous polls would ensure a presidential election type campaign of Modi versus the rest of opposition leaders, and subsume local issues in states like Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. The latest example of this was in Gujarat, where the PM?s blitzkrieg of an election campaign was the difference between the BJP?s win and an embarrassing defeat because of widespread anger over farm distress and GST (goods and services tax) implementation.Let?s first take the Opposition views on the practicality of simultaneous polls.Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram, a noted constitutional lawyer, said on Tuesday that Modi?s ?one nation one poll? was yet another ""election jumla"", or gimmick. He said it cannot be done under the current constitutional provisions.Chidambaram said the Constitution of India does not give a fixed term to any government and unless it is amended, one cannot havesimultaneous elections.?This is another of this election jumla. One nation, one tax was a jumla. Now, \'one nation, one election\' is a jumla,"" he said, at the launch of a book authored by him.Chidamabaram said one can artificially construct the appearance of a simultaneous election by advancing some elections and postponing some, and one could hold parliamentary election and elections to five or six states, but not in all the 30 states.

Chidambaram pointed out the case of Germany, where provinces go to polls at different times. At the same event, Congress Lok Sabha member Shashi Tharoor said simultaneous polls was a good idea, but not practicable. He said better solutions needed to be found to some of the practical problems.Recently, Communist Party of India (Marxist) chief Sitaram Yechury said his party would support simultaneous polls, but only if the Modi government also agreed to repeal Article 356 of the Constitution, that has been misused often to dismiss state governments. He has also termed simultaneous polls as anti-democratic and to subvert parliamentary democracy.On the second issue of trust deficit, Congress leader RPN Singh puts it succinctly. ?They couldn?t ensure simultaneous polls for Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat this time, when these two states have gone to polls together for nearly two decades,? he said.', 'But the real reason that Modi is canvassing support for simultaneous polls, Congress leaders say, is purely from electoral motivations.']",/article/politics/why-opposition-parties-are-not-enthused-about-one-nation-one-election-118013100723_1.html

If news reports are to be believed, the Congress, which has 54 members in the Rajya Sabha, is not too keen on being part of the campaign to remove Justice Misra. Even if theCongressdecides to not jump onto the bandwagon, the Communists would still have the minimum numbers with the help of other parties to initiate a motion in theRajya Sabha.Some of the dark horses in this quest could be theAam Aadmi Party(four members) andAll India Dravida Munetra Kazhagam(13 members) who could go either way, depending on their political interests. (See graphic)In theLok Sabhatoo, if the Communists get the support of the same parties that are backing it in the Rajya Sabha, it could ratchet up 173 MPs. With the minimum requirement of 100 MPs, the CPM could initiate a notice in theLok Sabhaas well.While giving a notice to remove Justice Misra in theRajya Sabhamay be easy withCongressbacking, the rest of the process may be paved with impediments that the Communists may not be able to circumvent with ease. The Judges Inquiry Bill, 1968 states that once the notice is given, the speaker of the House may or may not accept the motion. In case the Communists take theRajya Sabharoute, this discretion would lie withRajya SabhachairmanVenkaiah Naidu.If Naidu accepts the motion, he will be required to constitute a three-member judicial committee to frame specific charges against Justice Misra on the basis of which an investigation would be conducted against him. This is where things could get tricky. The three members of the committee need to include a Chief Justice or a judge of the Supreme Court, a chief justice of any high court and a ?distinguished jurist.?With fourSupreme Courtjudges openly antagonistic to Justice Misra, there could potentially be questions raised over the composition of the committee formed to investigate charges against him. The inclusion or exclusion of the hostile judges -? Justices J Chelameswar, Ranjan Gogoi,Madan LokurandKurian Joseph?- from the committee to investigate charges against Justice Misra would create its own set of complications.The Communists could also be racing against time in their quest for removing Justice Misra from the highest judicial office in the country. Justice Misra is slated to retire as theChief Justice of Indiaon October 2, 2018. This effectively gives the Communists two Parliamentary sessions -? the ongoingBudget sessionand the monsoon session -? to achieve its stated target.', 'Once Justice Misra demits office later this year, none of these motions or reports would have any bearing on him. The Judges Inquiry Act ,1968 does not mandate any time limit within which the judicial committee needs to submit its report to the chairman of theRajya Sabha.']",/article/current-affairs/impeaching-cji-dipak-misra-are-the-communists-living-in-fool-s-paradise-118013100784_1.html

Starting with a Rs 10,000 startup fund in the 2014 Budget, the government followed it up with a Rs 1,000 crore fund for tech startups and entrepreneurs in the 2015 budget, a 100 percent tax holiday for startups for the first three years of existence in 2016 and a further tax exemption in 2017 (25% for smaller companies) to make startups one of the very important cogs in the Indian economy?s wheel.While the government?s continuous push to bolster the startup ecosystem has undoubtedly come and helped the startup ecosystem, following are the two significant anticipations from theUnion Budget 2018-2019.1. Financial assistance to help Startups attract top talentAttracting top talent is critical to the success of any startup. Startups compete for talent with multinationals, and cannot offer large cash packages as compared to large competitors. We propose the following two ways in which the downside of joining a startup can be minimized for high-quality talent-a. The Government can look at lowering the income tax slabs for startup employees, which will not only keep the talent motivated but also help in retaining themb. Joining a startup may lead to an unsecured retired life. For small setups, benefits like PF may not apply. Therefore, the Government can provide support to such employees by contributing a portion of retiral/ pension schemesPart of 10,000 crore fund can be used for the above two ?direct support? schemes which will benefit all eligible startups without any administrative costs being incurred. (Investing in startups via intermediary funds include a management/ administrative fee).2. Simplification and faster execution of existing schemesWhile the Government approved the establishment of Rs 10,000 crore Fund of Funds (FFS) scheme in June 2016, only Rs 600* crore has been released to Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) by the Finance Ministry. Point to be noted is the fact that the disbursal of funds to startups after sanctioning of funds to venture capital funds (VCFs) has a time lag of two-three years.In addition to the funds, the Government must also look at simplifying the taxation arrangement under which only 74* startups have been approved last year. Approvals from DIPP, and then from IMB for taxation benefits have turned out to be a tedious process. One alternative can be assisting startups by diminishing their cost in the premature years rather than giving them tax holidays in the first three years since the maximum companies do not make any profit in the primary years.Strategies like direct tax benefits and capital availability that work to promote large-scale business may not be the best strategies for startups. Startups have the inherent advantage of being nimble, cost-efficient and innovative. The Government should also imbibe these virtues as it comes up with strategies to create a vibrant startup ecosystem in the country.

This happens because ofinformation asymmetry:situations where one party to a transaction has more or better information than the other. Due to the complexity and uncertainty of medical treatment, patients were unable to evaluate the quality of service being provided. In turn,doctorsexercised undue influence over patients. Some common problems with doctors, like unnecessary tests, operations and prescriptions are explained by this theory.', 'Kenneth Arrow, in hisseminal paperon medical care, showed that medicine was plagued withinformation asymmetry.

Expectations about rationalisation of tax rates are high among individuals and corporates, while economists are closely tracking adherence to fiscal discipline. Amidst all the voices, the investment community too is looking forward to clarity on a few issues.Long-term capital gains ? will the yearly debate come to a close?At present, capital gains on listed securities are exempt from tax, provided, the security has been held for more than a year and the Securities Transaction Tax has been paid on both purchase and sale transactions. With Indian public equity markets experiencing a sustained bull-run for the past few years, the on-going debate on taxability of capital gains on listed securities has gained fresh momentum in the build up to the UnionBudget.Constant pressure on the government to augment tax receipts, absence of comparable international jurisprudence, resultant inequitable tax treatment to other assets classes such as real estate and gold, make a case for a re-look at this exemption. However, any move to tax capital gains is likely to evoke sharp reactions and the possibility of a downward correction of the markets could be one repercussion. Alternatives such as extending the prescribed holding period from one to three years, making exemption subject to reinvestment of capital gains, or capping the exempt gains to a prescribed amount, may be considered by the government to neutralise the possibility of a negative impact. Investors will keenly watch the upcoming UnionBudget2018-19 to see if the government finally walks the tightrope and deals with the issue of taxability of capital gains.Cryptocurrencies ? Need for clarityThe rate of growth in the value of cryptocurrencies and the surrounding tax and regulatory issues have constantly tried to outpace each other in the past year. From an Indian policy standpoint, the government is evaluating a report by an expert committee on the existing global regulations governing crypto currencies and the central bank has repeatedly cautioned public of the inherent related risks. As per reports, the government is even toying with the idea of launching its own cryptocurrency and while that maybe one reality, the other is the Income-tax department recently launching search operations at various cryptocurrency exchanges across the country with notices being issued to individuals on the basis of information collected.In the absence of any clear regulation in India, ambiguity remains on the legality and other issues like taxability which investors would wish to be addressed in the UnionBudget2018-19. The primary issue of classification as a currency or a capital asset would need to be addressed by the central bank and will form the basis of determining taxability. Other potential issues include taxability of income as capital gains or business income which, inter-alia, can be determined by the intention of the purchaser and the frequency and volumes of trading. Being intangible, cryptocurrencies are devoid of specific identification and issues like determination of cost of acquisition and period of holding of the cryptocurrency sold requires clarification.

Reduction of import duty on Coking Coala. Currently import duty on Coking Coal is 2.5% and many of the steel companies are dependent upon imported coking coal as the domestic quality is not suitable for the steel industry, due to higher ash content.b. The import duty to be levied should be NIL as this would in turn help the steel industry to reduce the raw material cost and would increase productionc. During FY18 (April ? September), 22.6 MT of coking coal was imported. India?s coking coal imports have increased by 9.9% y-o-y basisd. The removal of import duty would help in reducing the cost of producing the end product and would help to increase the profitability of steel companies, which would in turn benefit the industry as well aseconomyas a whole2. Indian steel companies are also requesting for exemption from Environmental Cess.3. Removal of import duty on stainless steel scrap:For the manufacturing of stainless steel in electric furnace, stainless steel scrap is the key raw material. This scrap is not available in India and has to be imported and hence Customs duty on import of scrap may be reduced to NIL from current duty of 2.5%.4. Boost in Infrastructure developmenta. The domestic consumption of steel per capita is around 65 kg only compared to global average, which is 235kg, which indicates a huge gap in per capita consumption in India.b. India being the 3rd largest steel producer in India need to match up global standard and need to improve its per capita domestic consumption through investment in various infrastructure projects in semi?urban and rural areas.c. Initiatives like ?Make in India? is expected to boost the investment in infrastructure and thereby on demand for domestic steel would also increase.d. Where the Steel Ministry is estimating to increase the per capita steel consumption to the level of 160 kg by 2030 from the existing level, initiatives should be created to increase the domestic consumption by investment more in smart cities, affordable housing, overall infrastructure development of the country which would indirectly not only help Steel industry, but also many other industry such as cement, automobiles, housing etc. industry also.5. Reduction in export duty on Iron Ore upto 62% Fe (Ferrous Content)a.

The sector logged a healthy 8 percent revenue growth in the first half of fiscal 2017, but failed to sustain momentum thereafter following demonetization of high-value notes. This restricted full-year growth to just 6 percent on-year.GST ImpactIn August 2016, the GST bill was passed by the Indian Parliament. It was levied on as many as 178 products, including chocolates, cosmetics, detergents and air-fresheners etc. Some firms operating in categories such as FMCG, consumer electronics and food retail reaped the benefits in the form of reduced logistics costs and lowering of taxes. However, other segments, such as soft drink manufacturers and e-tailers have had to pay higher taxes. Many companies like HUL passed on this cost advantage to the end consumer, but quite a few others did not. Especially those that carried long pipeline stocks did not pass on the advantage despite the government making it clear that it was the responsibility of the companies to ensure that their entire retail is directing to announce this to the end user.E-commerceThis got a huge fillip, thanks to demonetization and GST, andaided FMCG sector on an everyday level. Monthly groceries that were traditionally cash and carry were now going cashless. The adoption to this online mechanism has been surprisingly quick, compared to expectations. Aggregators like big basket or Amazon grocery, are trying a new route to deepen relationships with consumers.Corresponding to the growth of e commerce, one saw the decline in Television advertising paving way to viral marketing in social media. Brands getting marketed through this medium increased. Examples included new screens/modes like Netflix, Hotstar, Jio movies, endangering the blockbuster/events driven advertising which has been the mainstay of FMCG advertising. Even Nestle relaunched its noodles via Snapdeal, a tribute to the reach of E-commerce.What to expect in FMCG -2018?Favorable demographics and rise in income level will boost FMCG market in 2018. This industry in India is expected to grow at a CAGR of 20.6 per cent and is expected to reach US$ 103.7 billion by 2020 from US$ 49 billion in 2016. Growing awareness, easier access, and changing lifestyles are the key growth drivers for the consumer market. The Government of India's policies and regulatory frameworks such as GST and demonetization are expected to drive demand, both in the rural and urban areas, and economic growth in a structured manner in the long term and improve performance of companies within the sector.Quarterly growth trends are positive for the industry already, but that is partly also because the comparison basis of last year same quarter was low! Some other trends to look forward to:· \xa0Ethnic positioning seems to be gaining favor- some examples are Paper boat beverages from Hector, Cheddar foods into the banana/tapioca chips segment as against KFC ( shutting down in some places) to Dominos that has reported slow growth. Western trends in foods seems to have slowed down and desi is clearly up.·Fitness/Health- this is expected to grow more... Consumer awareness in this area fueled by ?organic? farm foods and gym/work out areas- this is one segment that will continue to bring in the money.Rural is picking up demand.Semi-urban and urban segments accounted for a revenue share of 40 per cent in the overall revenues recorded by FMCG sector in India. Affordability will be the primary focus as companies target the rural folks. Smaller unit packs that encourage bottom of the pyramid to purchase products will be seen more and more. Britannia?s Tiger is going to see revival in packaging and in distribution/availability. Dabur is revamping its Dabur Red toothpaste. Patanjali is further entering rural India with its various brands.EXPECTATIONS FROM 2018 BUDGET-for FMCGAs per a report, makers of Fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) are expected to see nearly 15% revenue growth in the quarter ending December 31, 2017. The reason provided for the growth is improved consumer sentiment and rise in rural demandFrom a FMCG perspective, for GST benefits to reach the consumers, organizations like Mars (confectionary) are investing in instore technology to ensure monitoring of this.Dabur, which makes Vatika shampoo and Fem skin-care products, plans to release ads telling consumers about the price reductions as well as to monitor the trade closely. Kolkata based Emami is also planning to do similar things.Analysts expect tax policy for cigarettes to be soft, with an anticipation of an increase in excise duty on cigarettes by 10 percent across slabs and also the likely introduction of 59-mm segment in the current slab structure.Given the above importance of rural in fueling the economy, thebudgetis expected to favor this segment. The plan of ?double rural income in the next 5 years? may get further clarity on its implementation.In order to boost e commerce, miniaturized Point of Sale (POS) card reader for m-POS, iris scanners, fingerprint readers/scanners and micro ATM standards version 1.5.1 that have been exempted from BCD, excise/ Countervailing Duty (CVD) and Special Additional Duty (SAD), will continue that way.According to CRISIL, overall FMCG is to see volume-driven growth and improved margins. However, rising input prices of raw materials such as crude oil and milk will restrict further margin expansion.The author is Associate Professor ?

Given the fact that thisbudgetis going to be the lastbudgetof the ruling government before the 2019 general election, expectations of the market are varying from populist to surprise to stringent measures that the government is likely to take (especially, since this government has followed this approach in past).We expect thebudgetto be not so populist. The government has been making a serious attempt to bring theBudgetcloser to what it essentially is ? a mere accounting and allocation exercise and it would continue to do so this year as well.We expect the government to initiate measures and allocate funds effectively to revive investments and alleviate rural distress which would create the much needed jobs and drive the growth momentum. We also look forward to see what the government does to remain on the glide path of fiscal consolidation.The government has built fiscal credibility during the last three years by achieving the targeted levels. This year, the structural changes led by demonetisation and GST have exerted challenges to the government to achieve the current year?s target. Concerns are thus high about how the government will manoeuvre public expenditure towards rural and infrastructure segments.Therefore, the UnionBudgetof 2018-19 is likely to thrust on the following major areas:A slip on fiscal deficit targetWe believe the slippage in the fiscal deficit target to be modest. Given the structural change in the indirect taxation system, a deviation in the fiscal deficit, if small, should not impact the rating of the government?s performance. Given that GST is eventually expected to broaden the tax base and generate more revenue, the initial shortfall should be overlooked unless a major deficit is recorded.We believe the gap in fiscal deficit to be supported by higher-than-budgeted small savings collections as the government has cut the interest rate on small savings deposits including PPF for the last quarter of FY18. The government has been able to meet the disinvestment target this year and the target has been revised upwards to cover the shortfall in non-tax revenue. On the other hand, a shortfall in non-tax revenue is anticipated as revenue realisation from telecom spectrum sale may not materialise.We believe that the government will stick to its earlier fiscal deficit target of 3.0% for FY19. There are, however, concerns regarding high food subsidy, interest outgo owing to affordable housing, high fuel subsidy and expected higher capex allocation forrural developmentwhich is likely to increase the expenditurebudgetof the government. However, we believe that once the GST process normalises, increase in GST returns will be higher than FY18. This coupled with increase in direct tax collections as the economy is expected to clock in a higher growth rate which will help the government to stay put on path of fiscal consolidation.1. Agriculture and Rural DevelopmentAgriculture andrural developmentis likely to get greater focus in terms of allocation of funds and direction of measures. Resources need to be redirected towards more structural reforms required in place of short term measures like farm loan waivers.We believe increase in net irrigated area (percentage of Gross Irrigated Area over Gross Cropped Area is little more than 45%), effective implementation of crop insurance, expansion of agricultural marketing under National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) and improving post-harvest infrastructure such as warehouses and cold storage would ensure effective price realisation and address the issue of commodity price volatility. We expect the government to direct its funds in the above areas.The government has already set up a committee to chart out initiatives to double the farmers? income by 2022. \xa0The model contract farming act to counter price risks has also been drafted by the centre. We hope that the measures the government adopts should achieve the following i.e. ensuring fair price realisation of agricultural products, establishing a strong agri-logistic infrastructure, wider coverage of irrigation network along with providing the farmers a risk cover against price volatility. We believe thatrural developmentwould get a major leap if the interconnectivity is enhanced. Connectivity for greater market access for commercial activities, connectivity for access to health and education and connectivity to financial network of institutions and market has been a long standing need. In this context, the concept of rurbanisation introduced by the government in its 2014budgetneeds to be reinvigorated. While the process of identification and approval of Rurban clusters in various states is in progress, the action plan should be accelerated.2. InfrastructureWhile the government has taken infrastructure related initiatives outside the preview of the Union Budget, it is the capital expenditure which is likely to get special attention during this year?sbudget.Reviving investments will continue to remain the focus area, especially as the sentiment of private players remains subdued. The government has continued its thrust towards infrastructure during the course of the year and we expect higher allocation in the next year as well. While the government reports the state of implementation of itsbudgetannouncements every year, it is difficult to estimate the extent and nature of spending in the overall infrastructure sector. A reporting of the aggregate spending will be quite useful in this regard. Rural infrastructure, urban transportation, solar power, inland waterways and overall green infrastructure is expected to receive impetus during thebudget.a) LogisticsThe government has initiated many projects such as Bharatmala, Sagarmala, UDAN, etc. to overhaul the logistic sector and has placed an emphasis on green infrastructure. These commendable initiatives need to be followed through to completion to ensure that these are executed in target timelines. The thrust on creating green infrastructure is expected to continue while there could be higher allocation for the transport sector considering the need for improvising public transport. Thrust on the big ticket projects, Bharatmala and Sagarmala, will eventually benefit this sector. There should be an increased thrust to create multimodal logistics parks since logistics cost remains very high.b) Affordable housingIncrease in deduction limit on principal repayment and on interest payment for housing loans is expected.c) PowerProviding land for solar manufacturers on a long term lease, higher allocation for development of grid infrastructure and incentive schemes for R&D are expected.d) Infrastructure financeSignificant surge in the infrastructure financing can be challenging for the government given risk on fiscal deficit. Hence, measures to attract private funds and foreign funds could be expected. Announcement of measures to revive public-private partnerships and creation of an asset recycling strategy or monetisation of government assets to ensure flow of funds for stepping-up public expenditure is expected. Provisions for deepening the infrastructure finance ecosystem such as channelising of insurance and pension funds for infrastructure projects could be announced.3. Manufacturing SectorThe expectations of continued thrust on the overall infrastructure sector and renewed focus on the agriculture sector are likely to provide derived demand to multiple manufacturing sectors like Cement, Steel, Aluminium, Plastics, Automotive etc. In order to provide a boost to the Government?s ?Make in India? Programme, some products that go as raw materials in certain finished products would see customs duty relaxation.At the same time, upward revision in customs duty on certain finished products is expected, so as to encourage domestic manufacturing. \xa0As part of the Government?s ease of doing business initiatives, theBudgetis expected to see measures aimed at relaxing the customs regime for companies, including release of imported items without any upfront duty payment.Although we do not expect a significant cut in corporate tax rate, considering the wide gap between estimated and actual realisation of GST revenues, we expect Indian businesses to get marginal relief on the corporate tax front.SOME KEY SECTORAL EXPECTATIONS:? Automobiles:The sector can expect increased demand if the Government announces financial incentives to replace vehicles older than 10-15 years. We expect theBudgetto announce certain incentives for electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing companies and on EV charging infrastructure and duty rationalization on certain imported parts for EVs. Higher bus orders are expected under the JNNURM scheme. Measures for the agriculture sector to push income levels also augur well for the automobiles sector, particularly two-wheelers and trucks.? Capital goods and engineering:A higher budgetary allocation to the infrastructure sector would drive order books of capital goods and engineering companies. We also expect increased budgetary allocation to the defence sector, which augurs well for the capital goods sector and commercial vehicle manufacturers.? BFSI sector:The UnionBudgetis expected to provide some relief to insurance sector by changing the tax incentives structure. The insurance businesses are impacted by higher GST rate. Hence, an increase in the tax deduction limit might provide some relief to insurance holders. We expect the UnionBudgetto provide more clarity on recapitalisation bonds for PSU banks and a roadmap on consolidation of PSU banks. The government could allow 100% FDI in private sector banks. Further, few measures to incentivise flow of credit to affordable housing and MSMEs are expected.The thrust on digital transactions is likely to strengthen as the UnionBudgetcould provide incentives on digital transactions up to a certain limit for small businesses. \xa0There could also be a push for e-Sign and e-KYC.? Consumer Goods:TheBudgetis expected to announce incentives for setting up warehouses and cold chain facilities and measures to increase foreign investments in the sector.? Gems & Jewellery:To revive demand for gold in the country and boost exports of jewellery, the UnionBudgetis expected to announce reduction in import duty on gold.? Textiles & Garments:To boost exports of textiles & garments, the Government may increase the duty drawback rates from the existing 2%.The author is Lead Economist - \u200eDun & Bradstreet India']",/budget/article/budget-2018-will-look-to-revive-investments-alleviate-rural-distress-118013101034_1.html

In its journey so far, agriculture and allied sector has played and will continue to play a significant role in providing employment and sustainable livelihoods for the growing population in India. Over 58 per cent of the rural households depend on agriculture as their principal means of livelihood. As per the 2nd revised estimates by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), the share of agriculture and allied sectors (including agriculture, livestock, forestry and fishery) is estimated to be 17.3 per cent of the Gross Value Added (GVA) during 2016-17 at 2011-12 prices.The pattern of agricultural holdings and the profile of agricultural households in India indicate that there is a dominance of small farmers and small farm holdings in the agricultural sector, who are highly indebted and are vulnerable to shocks and poverty. In line with other economic activities, agriculture entails various risks attached with it owing to issues of inputs, market prices, credit and other policy domains. Managing and reducing these risks can increase the incomes, profitability and ensure stable income flows to the farmers.The Economic Survey 2016-17 classified the overall risks entailed in agriculture under the following heads: Production risks? Weather & Disaster related risks? Price risks? Credit risks? Market risks and Policy risksThe Survey of 2016-17 had suggested several corrective measures aimed at solving farm sector issues. It was suggested to have a check on the skewed distribution of fertilizer subsidies, pricing policies and the resultant imbalances in the usage of fertilizers to retain the soil fertility. Dealing with the issues of water stress requires promotion and shifting to efficient water usage, micro irrigation techniques like drip and sprinkler irrigation. Effective use of weather/climate forecasts along with advanced IT and communication techniques can come handy for mitigating the weather related risks. Catering to the risks posed by price fluctuations and existing market mechanism, the solution lies in shifting to new seed varieties that have a longer shelf life and a shorter maturity time. Expanding the domain of formal sources of credit to the marginalized and distressed farmers uniformly throughout the country can help them move out of the vicious cycle of debt trap. The minimum support price (MSP) backed procurement of crops by Government agencies, intends to benefit the farmers directly. To make farming remunerative, Direct Benefit transfer(DBT) of inputs would be of great help to the farmers. The Survey also focused on removing the restrictions on internal trade on agricultural commodities and dismantling the fragmented legislations governing agriculture to let the real benefits flow down to the farmers sitting at the base of the pyramid. The stock limits imposed under Essential Commodities Act, 1955 ended up curtailing demand for farm produce. It was suggested to carry out the rationalisation of this limit to cover the price fluctuation risks.The last three fiscals have witnessed the Government taking action towards many of these gaps and irregularities. Addressing the deteriorating soil fertility affecting agricultural yield, the soil health card initiative and the Direct Benefit Transfer on fertilizers were introduced. There has been a substantial increase in the availability of certified quality seeds for wheat, paddy, barley, maize and potato over the previous year records. Targeting water stress and irrigation related risks, micro irrigation system was introduced on a pilot basis. The result was found to be favorable across many states covering Rajasthan, Odisha & Haryana. Owing to the price risks, farmers are encouraged to adopt a stable pattern of sowing so that in the long run, they receive a stable price of the produce. Promoting the formal credit market, the corpus of Long term Rural Credit Fund of NABARD was increased to Rs. 15,000 crore in 2016-17. Under the Interest Subvention Scheme (ISS) in 2016-17, farmers availed crop loans up to Rs. 3 lakh at 7 per cent interest and the effective rate of interest was lowered to 4 percent for those who repaid their loans promptly. UnionBudget2017-18 gave a push to market reforms in agriculture, increased funding for crop insurance and had set a higher target for farm credit by announcing a whopping Rs. 1 lakh crore increase in credit target. \xa0It was announced to increase the coverage under Fasal Bima Yojana by additional 10% of the cropped area compared to the previous fiscal. The Long Term Irrigation Fund, NABARD was announced to be augmented by 100% to improve the access to irrigation. Centre had urged the state Governments to delist perishables such as vegetables and fruits from the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) domain allowing the farmers to sell these commodities directly to consumers and earn a better price. Expanding the coverage of National Agricultural Market (e-NAM) was announced from 250 markets to 585 APMCs. \xa0It was announced to create dedicated micro irrigation funds and dairy processing funds. In line with the soil health card, setting up of mini labs was announced across all the Krishi Vigyan Kendras for soil testing. It als0 proposed a model law on contract farming to be shared and discussed with the states.Budget2018: Looking forwardIn an attempt to further address the farm sector distress, we look forward to seeing the following measures inBudget2018:? Private players should be incentivised to deploy modern technologies in weather/climate related predictions and forecasts which along with advanced research backed cropping pattern can help to minimise the unexpected farm losses.? To enhance productivity, a well-designed foolproof mechanism for implementation of genetically modified crops should be established.? Incentives to increase coverage of crop insurance and inviting insurance companies to develop innovative insurance products for the sector and government providing cover would be further welcome with safeguards related to claim processing.? Greater investments in storage facilities and establishment of cold chains would be another expectation from thebudgettowards reducing food wastage.? Policy measures to promote institutional arrangements such as contract farming, producers? organisations, and cooperatives that provide farmers easy access to markets, distribute price risks, and reduce marketing and transaction costs would be very welcome.? An expansion of the coverage of National Agricultural Market (e-NAM) and contract farming related announcements will be very welcome.It is very important that farm sector stress is addressed by the government earnestly as it would have a virtuous impact on the overall economy of the country as well as on the social fabric of the country.The author is Leader (Public Finance and Economics), PwC IndiaViews expressed are personal']",/budget/article/budget-2018-investments-in-agri-the-best-weapons-against-poverty-hunger-118013101024_1.html

It should focus on a comprehensive look at the health policy ?sick-care to wellness?, prevention and health promotion, financial protection, stronger partnership with the private sector and raising public health expenditure to 2.5 per cent of the GDP in a time bound manner. There has to be a concrete proposal of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) that guarantees free, cashless health services to all citizens. This is what was completely missing before in terms of healthcare as a fundamental right.UHC, in which people receive healthcare without suffering financial hardship, is an ideal that many countries in the world are successfully moving towards. Thailand has already shown the rest of the world that even with poor resources, UHC is achievable. India has agreed to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) by 2030 -- a promise made by the UPA government. It's the new minimum in global health, without which no policy orBudgetmakes sense.TheBudgetshould also make the right proposals in identifying the pitfalls of India's healthcare situation. It should acknowledge poor state spending (1% of the GDP), catastrophic expenses people suffer because 70% of their needs are met by the private sector, and how poor access to healthcare pulls down the country's development goals. It should acknowledge the need for UHC in primary, secondary as well as tertiary care because all three sectors are equally important. It should promise improved access and affordability of services through a combination of public hospitals and strategic purchasing of services from the private health sector.Budget2018 should also seek to strengthen the infrastructure, capacity, financing and human resources, and envisage a complete overhaul of primary care. The idea of primary care should include important elements that had been part of secondary or even tertiary care earlier. It should seek to harness the complementary results of the initiatives by other sectors - such as cleanliness drive, reduction of train and road accidents, and action against gender-based violence - into the newBudgetfor greater synergy.TheBudgetshould speak about a single purchaser or payer for health, which essentially means that the government would buy the healthcare services for its people, who need not worry about paying for them. The policy should promise that it would buy services mostly from public hospitals; but should also use the private players to fill in the gaps. \xa0The most crucial element this year is a strong public health infrastructure.

The corresponding ratio in countries like China, Korea and others, with which India has to compete in the global market, is over sixty per cent.The workforce is therefore woefully unproductive due mainly to the abysmal state of India?s education system, which churns out millions of adults equipped only for menial work. Its graduates go on to toil in small and micro enterprises that operate in the informal sector, which employs over 90 per cent of the entire workforce. And, we have a large pool of ?unemployable graduates?, which causes huge waste of resources.The reason for the unacceptably low quality of education or deficiency in entrepreneurial training is grossly inadequate investment in education andskills development.And, the promises made by theNarendra Modigovernment during the past four years to increase budgetary allocations and to formulate new education policy have been belied.It is unlikely that in the ensuing financial year, 2018-19, which faces the twin challenge of risingfiscal deficitand concerns about winning the forthcoming elections, funds would be made available to improve the performance and accountability responsiveness ofeducation system.Consider the following:Allocation of budgetary resources for educational development hovers around 3.7 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). Successive Central governments, including Modi's, have made oft-repeated commitments to allocate at least six per cent of GDP, which have never been realised.Realising that the Central government was unable to fulfil the Constitutional obligation of ensuring ?universalisation of education? for children up to fourteen years due in part to paucity of financial resources, an ?education cess? has been collected since 2004 fromincome taxpayers to augment funds for investment in education.

The primaryeducation cessis used to meet part of expenditure onSarva Shiksha Abhiyan(SSA) andMid Day Meal(MDM) Schemes.

A reasonable reduction in the existing personal tax rates would bring cheers to the taxpayers especially in the wake of rising inflation and reducing purchasing power, says the Deloitte Personal tax survey 2018.The Personal tax survey captures the views of 697 mid-level managers and attempts to gauge the mood of the taxpayers ahead of thebudget.About 55% of the respondents want the basic exemption limit to be raised from INR 250,000 to INR 500,000. Interestingly, 84% of the respondents are keen on aligning the tax year (April-March) with the calendar year (January-December).With the increasing cost of education, majority of the respondents (94%) indicated an additional deduction should be introduced towards the expenses incurred for education of children (up to two children) with a minimum limit of INR 5000 per month per child. Such a move on this front will make educational expenses more affordable for the middle-class Indian families.The Government should offer further tax rebates on home loans in order to fulfil its dream of ?Housing for All? by 2022 and to give a leg-up to the ailing realty sector. In the survey, 51% respondents said that in case of self -occupied property, deduction of interest on housing loan should be extended to at least INR 350,000from the prevailing amount of INR 200,000. Further, in case of an individual owning more than one house property, only one can be considered to be self-occupied. If the other properties are vacant, still a notional rent is offered to tax. According to the survey, 58% of the respondents opined that the concept of taxability of deemed rent on vacant properties should be discontinued. Interestingly, 29% of the respondents indicated otherwise.In line with the gradual reduction of corporate tax rates for domestic companies from 30% to 25%, most respondents are in favour of a similar reduction in the tax rates for individuals from 30% to 25%. Salaried employees are keen to see an increase in the limit for deduction under Section 80C towards certain payments and investments, currently capped at INR 150,000.The tax-free limit for medical expenses, which currently is INR 15,000 annually, was considered inadequate by all respondents. More than half the respondents (58%) are in favour of increasing the limit to INR 40,000 annually, while the remaining (42%) want to double the limit to INR 30,000.Any free meal that is provided by the employer to the employee is taxable if the value exceeds INR 50 per meal. All managers want this limit to be increased in the range of INR 100 to INR 200 per meal. Two out of every five respondents (42%) want it to be raised to INR 200 per meal, the remaining want it in the range of INR 100 to INR 150.Close to two-thirds (64%) of the respondents gave a thumbs-up to the concept of jurisdiction-free e-assessment. E-assessments are seen as part of the tax department's endeavour to expedite and simplify assessment proceedings, reduce the taxpayer's inconvenience and stamp out corruption. However, 20% of the respondents believe that this move would not be beneficial.

Unfortunately, there are not enough institutions like we have ITIs for technical training for training professionals on insurance business. This situation will only get more acute with time unless a solution is worked on right now. I would recommend that expenditure of insurance companies on providing insurance related vocational training leading to employment be given a tax break in the form of deduction from tax payable. This will encourage more insurance companies to set up their own vocational training setups leading to greater employment and better managed growth of insurance business in India.Health InsurancePenetration of health insurance is woefully low in India. We have a strange phenomenon in India where health insurance penetration in relative terms is higher in BPL segment (due to Government sponsored schemes), middle class Government employees and in the affluent segment (due to higher awareness and ability to afford) as compared to the middle-lower middle income segments especially in the self-employed professional category in both large metros as well as small town India. While this segment may not be paying income tax , at the same time a large number of such self-employed professionals are today covered in the ambit of GST. Thus, while deductions in Income Tax may not be attractive to this segment, a set-off of GST payable could make a difference to them in terms of their cash flows and should be considered to encourage purchase of health insurance for themselves, their families as well as for their employees ? who probably are the most vulnerable and need it the most.Home InsuranceFor a large number of Indians, the biggest investment is in buying or building a home. With easier availability of mortgages and government thrust on affordable homes, Indians are not just investing their savings but also their future savings in buying or building homes. At the same time, exposure to natural calamities is only increasing with earthquakes, landslides, floods and inundation. Frequency of buildings collapsing also seems to have increased if one goes by news reports. A natural calamity in a large urban agglomeration could lead to severe losses to a very large number of home owners as less than 1% of homes in India are insured today. These losses could cause a large social upheaval and stress on Government resources as well as NPAs for mortgage lenders. There is, therefore, a crying need to increase the penetration of home insurance in India. Besides the lack of awareness, there seems to be a cultural opposition to insure homes as we believe that ?it will never happen to us?. This thinking needs to be changed and home owners need to be forced to get home insurance till it becomes an automatic part of buying/building homes in India. I would, therefore, recommend that buying home insurance be made a pre-requisite to registration of homes just like buying motor third party insurance is mandatory for registration of automobiles in India. This can start with new homes and then extended to others at the time of registration of lease agreements, changes in plans, extensions etc. Buying home insurance is a good habit and this has to be fostered forcibly to save our society from future catastrophic losses.The author is\xa0CEO & whole-time director at Liberty Videocon General Insurance']",/budget/article/budget-2018-fm-arun-jaitley-needs-to-focus-on-job-creation-insurance-118013101135_1.html

Yet the sector needs significant focus with a view to improving rural economy and livelihoods.Key Challenges1.Price Fluctuation:Farmers are frequently at the mercy of traders, inspite of good produce the price the farmers get is not sufficient to even cover the expenses. Initiatives such as Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) and Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs), which were supposed to protect the farmer are not helping in good returns.2.Lack of Infrastructure:Inadequate rural infrastructure, roads & transport systems, food processing units, reliable power and cold-storage, continue to hinder farm operations and increase costs. Further, there is limited access to resources such as financial services, credit, support expertise, educational services or irrigation solutions.3.Existing crop insurance do not benefit farmers:Insurance schemes are seen as an added burden over and above the loans the farmers are already struggling to pay. Less than 20% of farmers in India are covered under crop insurance.4.Poor performance of farm exports- The country is being denied market access in the name of health and safety regulations. Prohibitive import duties and high subsidies are constraining India?s farm exports. Measures have to be taken to incentivize India competitive agro products and removal of non-tariff barrier.5.Lack of technological advances:Farmers do not have access to quick soil testing methods to know micronutrients in the soil. \xa0Other challenges are poor access to market information for forecasting, weather, price & yield at the time of sowing.Budget2018 ExpectationsAgro reforms are the need of the day. To start with, the upcomingbudgetshould encourage Corporate-Farming to protect farmers from price risks. The government should strengthen recently drafted model contract farming act and encourage states to adopt it as per their needs.Small farmers usually do not benefit from the government assured Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) as they do not have enough marketable surpluses to justify the cost of transporting the crop to government corporations in the towns. Thereby, selling it to traders at rock-bottom prices. Even, Agricultural Produce Market Committees? (APMCs) monopoly has led to cartels of traders, commission agents and transporters being formed which have not benefited the farmers so far.Further, the existing crop insurance schemes have not provided any relief to the hapless farmers. The government needs to bring in more transparency in the term and conditions of the schemes, some of which are downright absurd. In addition, given the lower penetration of the crop insurance, more geography and more crops are to be covered under existing schemes.In addition, waiving farm loans has short-term relief to a limited section of the farmer and a costly option for the banking system. Instead, the government should spend a similar amount on the improvement of agriculture infrastructure which has a much larger multiplier effect on the economy in the long run.Lastly, the agro-research should get more funding. Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) has lost its glory over a period of time. The government should apply a mission mode approach to research for achieving the goal of doubling farmer?s income by the year 2022.Dairy IndustryMilk has highest value in Indian agri and food sector, more than combined value of wheat and rice. Milk contributes close to the 1/3rdof gross income of rural households. The livestock sector contributes to 4% of India?s GDP and the dairy sector comprises majority of share.Key Challenges1.Quality a big concern? More than 70% of marketable surplus goes through informal channel where quality is a big concern. Sometimes quality is an issue in the formal channel as well. Quality of milk or value-added products are a barrier to entry to the export market, especially the USA and the EU.2.Poor governance of cooperatives- Prices decided by cooperatives are not based on fat measurement, which affects Farmer?s profitability. In addition, lower prices declared by cooperatives, results in low prices of milk paid by all the players in the industry.3.Non-existent of extension facilities:Lack of adequate breeding and preventive care services to improve animal health, along with low access to credit and risk-taking ability makes farmers unable to increase their herd size.4.Taxation on value added products:Taxation on value added products would cause the industry to reduce the milk prices paid to the dairy farmers. High rate might also increase the consumer prices of dairy products substantially.BudgetExpectationsMilk is highly perishable, therefore value addition such as processing, packaging, and conversion to long life products, such as sterilized milks (UHT), dahi, paneer, chhachh, lassi, shrikhand and so on, is more a necessity than a luxury. It is crucial that a softer view is taken while imposing GST and imperative to create special class for dairy products with minimum value-addition.The government should have a farmer-centric approach, as perhaps milk is the only industry that is able to pay to the dairy farmers more than 2/3 of price charged to the consumer. No other food processing industry in India is able to meet such high expectations of the farmers. Tax exemption on dairy industry should not be considered as a loss to the national exchequer but an investment that would spur growth in milk production, which eventually would enhance rural prosperity and increase the farmer?s income.In addition, there should be level playing field for private players and the cooperatives.

The social status ascribed to him by birth did not allow him to study with the privileged in the social hierarchy. 2500 years hence, and 70 years after independence, elementary education in India is still deeply segregated. A majority of children from socio-economically disadvantaged families attend government schools while children from more privileged families attend high or middle income private schools. Besides depriving children of the well documented benefits of diverse classrooms, this segregation has a direct correlation to the nature of profession that these children take up as adults. Section 12 (1) (c) of the Right to Education(RTE) Act, 2009, also known as the RTE 25% provides for the creation of inclusive classrooms by mandating private unaided and specified category schools to admit in class I, to the extent of at least 25% of the strength of that class, children belonging to socio-economically disadvantaged families and provide free and compulsory elementary education till 8th grade.The spirit of the law asserts the right of children to study in the school of their choice irrespective of their socio-economic background. Since its enactment, the provision has been one of the most vigorously debated aspects of RTE with its validity being asserted by the Supreme Court of India, High Courts of various States and by the T.S.R Subramanian Committee formed by the Ministry of Human Resource Development(MHRD). Therefore, as a nation we are well past the debate on the validity of this provision and are now in a stage wherein we need to find solutions to the advanced administrative impediments arising on account of the implementation of this policy.Each year, more than 2 million children stand to benefit from this provision. In its reply to anunstarred question in the recently concluded winter session of the Parliament, the government stated that in the year 2016-17, close to 3 million children were enrolled under RTE 25% admissions policy. The policy is at a different stage of evolution in different parts of the country. The States and Union Territories(UTs) could broadly be categorised to be in two categories vis-a-vis the implementation of this provision. The first category comprises of states who have either not notified the policy or have not made enough efforts to implement it in right earnest. The second category consists of those states who are striving towards the implementation of the provision in letter and spirit, have met reasonable success and are now grappling with higher order issues like those of student retention and reimbursement management. For the first category States and UTs, what is needed is administrative and political will to adopt best practices from the several years of experience of States in the second category and leapfrog to a more advanced stage of implementation. The biggest challenge faced by the second category schools is with respect to reimbursements from the government.The RTE Act states that schools admitting children under this provision ?shall be reimbursedexpenditure so incurred by it to the extent of per-child-expenditure incurred by the State, or the actual amount charged from the child, whichever is less, in such manner as may be prescribed.? Over the past 3 years, thebudgetallocations for SSA by the Government of India remains far below the resource estimates submitted by MHRD to the Government of India(GoI). SSA received only 22,015 crore (revised estimates) in FY 2015-16 as opposed to a demand of 50,000 crore by MHRD and 22,500 crore (RE) in FY 2016-17 for a demand of'55,000 crore.Additionally, GOI allocations for Sarva Shikha Abhiyaan as a share of total MHRD allocations has been constantly decreasing, reducing from 33% of MHRD allocations in FY 2015-16 to 31% in FY 2016-17 and 29% in FY 2017-18. These inconsistencies have a direct bearing on the implementation of Section 12 (1) (c). According to the numbers provided by the government in the Parliament, from 2014-2017, 7.16 million children have been enrolled under the RTE 25% provision. Assuming a 10% drop out rate, and a conservative average per child cost of Rs.5,000, the outlay for the year 2016-17 should have been at least Rs. 3,220 cr. However, only 510 cr was actually approved, leading to a 6 fold deficit. Clearly, there is a need to increasebudgetallocations made to the MHRD under SSA.With MHRD already allocating less that what States demand for, and GoI allocating less than what MHRD asks for, the shortage is compounded. Therefore, there is an urgent need to increase the budgetary allocations under SSA if the States are to reimburse schools who are admitting children under this provision. Non receipt of reimbursement could potentially result in further reduction of school participation rates and even states backing out from implementing this provision as recently indicated by the stateof Uttarakhand.There are more micro level issues vis a vis reimbursements that needs urgent resolutions. For instance, the per child cost calculated by States takes into account only recurring costs and not the costs associated with fixed capital assets. This leads to reimbursements amounts which are much less than what schools actually spend on each child. Also, costs incurred by a parent in high and middle income private schools go much beyond tuition fees and costs associated with books and uniforms. It is here that we see an opportunity to link Corporate Social Responsibility(CSR) with the education of children from socio-economically disadvantaged families admitted under this provision. Additionally, every state is now moving towards digitising the whole RTE 25% admission process with end to end Management Information Systems(MIS) which include modules like school registration, applicant registration, online lottery, student tracking and reimbursement management which are resulting in a more transparent and cost effective implementation of the policy. There is a huge potential for IT firms to support development of these online systems through their CSR commitments.There is no denying that the implementation of this policy is fraught with challenges. However, the good news is we have proven solutions to these challenges. It would be an absolute travesty of justice if each year millions of children are deprived of access to the quality education in the school of their choice for want of appropriate budgetary allocations. It is high time we ensure that our Eklavyas and Arjuns study together in the same classroom with equitable distribution of resources to help integrate the socio-economically underprivileged children into formal education. \xa0For this, all stakeholders viz. the government, corporates and the civil society need to comes together to ensure ?collective impact? and the government needs to make its commitment to this policy unambiguously clear. The beginning of making this commitment clear is allocating requisite funds andbudget2018-19 is an excellent opportunity to get the ball rolling.The author is CEO of Indus Action""]",/budget/article/budget-2018-india-needs-to-focus-on-inclusive-education-for-development-118013101185_1.html

While the government is widely expected to overshoot the FY18 target, the math still seems workable for maintaining next year?s mark. It?s pertinent to note that it would still be among the lowest deficit levels in last three decades.On the latter, in what?s a recurring pre-budgetfear each year, there?s a possibility of the government maintaining status quo. But if it decides to address the issue, we hope it tries to revise and align taxes, not merely add yet another income source.On the spending front, notwithstanding the fact that we are just 15 months away from general elections, we expect the finance minister to be categorically pragmatic, focused on asset creation andeconomyboosting spends like infrastructure and on rejecting wasteful expenditure. In this context, Hon. Prime Minister?s recent media byte sounds reassuringly pro-reform, where he remarked that it?s a popular myth that the common man invariably expects freebies and sops from everybudget.Among other things, thisbudgetcould include crucial measures to make Railways more self-sufficient, stressing on generating internal resources to fund its plans and priorities.The government?s income projections have been consistently plausible in the past few years. This time we expect slightly more aggressive estimates, which the government would strive to meet through widening of tax base and imposing penalties on basis of demonetisation data and high disinvestment income. Overall, we expect a well-balancedBudget.We would also like to underline the fact that theBudgetwon?t be the sole platform for launching reforms and we could see a string of positive measures from the government during the course of the year.Notwithstanding the fact that the 2018 UnionBudgetwould be wary of the general elections in the following year, the government would not like to turn overtly populist, going by its resolve thus far and notwithstanding the spends in staple areas like public infrastructure, agriculture, affordable housing, and mass employment, especially immediately preceding the election year.Direct taxation:The government would lower corporate tax rates, especially at a time when USA is about to opt for lower rates, which underlines the need to become more competitive in offering a conducive environment to best of breed companies to set up base in India. Also, the fact remains that we squarely depend on FDI flow to fund our current account deficit. On personal income tax rates, the government would provide relief to tax payers who had to face a difficult time during the demonetization disruption span. We can expect some extra benefit under Section 80C, apart from the raising of individual-specific tax slabs.On its tax collection estimates, the government would prefer to be slightly more aggressive than before, but of course, without losing sight of the realism that they have maintained in their estimates till date. We could well see a higher tax income collection target, more so in the expectation of a windfall in the form of penalties post demonetization, with all the data mining in process and given the strong intent to widen the income tax base.Capital Market taxation: In the run-up to every UnionBudgetannouncement, fear of levy of long term capital gains tax (LTCG), GAAR, haunt the stock market. This year is no different, with fear of an end to the exemption of long term capital gains tax on equity investments. We reckon that the government will not like to dent the improving investor sentiment, where equity participation still remains low around 5-6% of the household savings. Having said that, it could change the long-term capital gain classification criteria from one year to two years. But in the same breath, the government must then have a serious relook at STT, abolish Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) as also reduce GST rates on share transactions from 18 per cent to 12 per cent. We may also see plugging of some loopholes like bonus stripping.Indirect taxation:Material action may not be seen since GST is now driving most of the government intent and rates are being reviewed in reactionary fashion - as and when the government feels rates need to be hiked or lowered on specific items. Customs duty may be tweaked though to benefit certain domestic industries.We see little risk to indirect tax collection from spike in crude in last few months. Our internal assessment foresees no material rise in crude oil prices from hereon. \xa0On the issue of fuel prices itself, the government may blend methanol with petrol to the extent of 15 per cent, to lower the incidence of fuel prices on the retail audience without having to materially cut taxation at their end. This blend of course, can be achieved outside theBudgettoo, and may not necessarily feature as aBudgetmeasure. The larger point is that the government would continue to be upbeat about indirect tax collection this time round.Fiscal Deficit:Given the landmark disruptions of the year, as also the reigning corporate slowdown, we can expect FY18 to go slightly off-mark, with a slippage of 10-20 basis points. But in the larger context of what the government has achieved on the fiscal discipline front, we can easily condone the slippage. We expect the government to reiterate its commitment to fiscal consolidation by continuing to aim for 3 per cent target for FY19. This is because it would like to signal low interest rates to the market as well as live up to expectations of global rating agencies who upgraded India rating. Besides, the debt-to-GDP ratio at ~70% is on the higher side and State finances are stressed. So, there?s clearly a need for proactively ensuring discipline of the fisc.It?s pertinent to note that the proposed recapitalization bonds would be below-the-line item with no impact on the fiscal deficit, except for the interest component, which is not significant in FY19.Disinvestment programme:Apart from a push to increase non-tax revenue in the form of dividends to meet the deficit target, we expect a large disinvestment programme in FY19. Given that the government prodigiously met the target for this year, its resolve has been amply demonstrated, and hence we can expect a high figure for coming year as well. Our internal forecast is for 25% return for the Nifty and Sensex in 2018, so capital market will likely remain supportive to help government meet its target.Expenditure:Save for arresting wasteful expenditure, it would be difficult to control total expenditure in a year before elections. Areas like infrastructure and affordable housing, health care, job creation and rural development would get attention. We even see a possibility of hike in minimum wages and farmer MSPs. Overall, the government will control spend on non-Plan expenditure (although it has done away with the distinction between Plan and non-Plan). It would focus on boosting economic activity while trying to minimize revenue expenditure.Another way of saving expenditure will be to ask certain departments to increasingly fund their own capex. For instance, with Mr. Piyush Goyal at the helm (who was appreciated in his work as Power Minister), the railways may look to raise resources internally through prudent measures like sale & lease back of transmission lines and land bank monetization. So, the government can now afford to stick to last year?s railway allocations or probably allot a marginally higher sum to it.The author is partner & head of research, IIFL']",/budget/article/budget-2018-preview-pragmatism-and-poise-expected-from-fm-arun-jaitley-118013101242_1.html

Expectations and excitement run high as it will be the first post-GST and last full-yearbudgetbefore the General Elections in 2019.* We note that the 2018-19Budgetwill be presented against the backdrop of uncertainty over tax collections post implementation of the Goods & Services Tax (GST). We expect the government to revise its deficit target to 3.4% of GDP for FY18 (higher than the budgeted estimate of 3.2%) and to 3.2% of GDP for FY19 (higher than the target of 3% set last year). It means that the plan to meet the 3% deficit target will be postponed by one year (to 2019-20) for the third time.* As the current government will present its last full-yearbudgetbefore the 2019 General Elections, many in the market expect a heavier dose of populism. However, we believe that the government has limited financial resources to propose any targeted scheme for the poor. We also do not expect much relief on the tax front, except some reduction in the corporate tax rate for medium-sized companies.* From an equity market perspective, it is important to see how theBudgetis able to make a difference to the rural sector, how the government is able to carry the burden of expectations, and whether theBudgetstrikes a right balance between good economics and good politics, especially with the General Elections around the corner next year. Also, as GST-related dust is still settling down, the markets will be keenly watching fiscal deficit projections and whether the long-term fiscal consolidation path is adhered to. We do expect the government to focus on rural and capex spending to boost sentiment and revive growth further. However, given the hard-achieved gains on fiscal consolidation, flexibility to go overboard on spending is limited, in our view. Consumption pick-up (especially rural and discretionary), cyclical recovery in corporate facing banks and gradual pick-up in private capex are our key themes to play in CY18. TITAN, EMAMI, UNSP, ICICI BANK, RBL, HDFC, SHTF, PETRONET, HPCL, TATA MOTORS, M&M, L&T, JSP, BHARTI are among our top ideas.In its previous budget, the center had budgeted 12-year slowest growth of 6.6% in total spending, making it clear that fiscal policy is reaching its limits. Not surprisingly then, economic activity weakened considerably in FY18, further pressurizing the government. Following the fiscal consolidation path amid growing demand to support economic recovery is the biggest challenge for the government. An anemic ruraleconomyand a weak investment cycle add to the concerns. It would, thus, be interesting to see how the Center handles the fires that are already raging.* We will discuss four key themes in this note. First, we provide our projections of FY18 revised estimates (RE) andbudgetestimates (BE) for FY19. We believe that the deficit target of 3% of GDP will be postponed by one year for the third time to 2019-20. We expect the government to revise the deficit target to 3.4% of GDP for FY18 (higher than the budgeted estimate of 3.2%) and to 3.2% of GDP for FY19 (higher than the target of 3% set last year).* Second, we believe that capital spending of the government will be budgeted to grow ~10% in FY19, following ~7% growth in FY18.* Third, we believe that rural spending may be revised upward for FY18; however, limited financial resources will make it difficult for the government to announce a targeted scheme for the poor.* Fourth, we expect the government to continue on its commitment to reduce the corporate tax rate by lowering tax for companies with turnover of up to INR25b. Such a measure could cost the government ~INR100b. Apart from this, we do not expect the government to provide further direct/indirect tax relief.Expect FY19 fiscal deficit to be budgeted at 3.2% of GDPIn its first UnionBudgeton 10th July 2014, the current government?s roadmap for fiscal consolidation proposed to reduce fiscal deficit to 3% of GDP by 2016-17. In the following two budgets, the 3% target was postponed to 2017-18 first and then to 2018-19. However, in the 2017-18 Budget, while the target was maintained for 2018-19, it appears highly susceptible once again. Considering that the government is almost certain to miss its 2017-18budgetestimates (BE) of fiscal deficit of 3.2% of GDP, we believe that the 3% deficit target will be postponed for the third time to 2019-20. According to our calculations, fiscal deficit for FY18 could be revised higher by up to 20 basis points (bp) to 3.4% of GDP, and it could be pegged at 3.2% of GDP for FY19.In line with our deficit estimates, we believe that gross market borrowings could rise from the revised estimate of INR6.3t in FY18 to INR7t in FY19. Scheduled repayments of about INR2.1t imply net market borrowings of ~INR4.9t in FY19 ? up from INR3.9t in FY18.It, however, is also important to note that net market borrowings will be 2.6% of GDP in FY19, higher than 2.4% in FY18, but lower than the levels seen in the previous years. It also implies that market borrowings will finance ~84% of fiscal deficit in FY19, higher than in the past two years, but lower levels than in the previous years. It is obvious that one-off events such as demonetization helped the government garner more resources from non-market sources and, thus, the share of market borrowings in FY17 and FY18 was much lower.Read full report here?

A major thrust is needed to increase the number of hospital beds in rural areas to improve India?s healthcare parameters and save lives of millions of people every year.Historically, Governments have given no incentives to entrepreneurs for setting up hospitals in rural areas. Whether city or village, the construction and running costs of a hospital are largely the same, and so is GST on medical equipment. However, the affordability factor of an urban patient is several magnitudes higher compared to rural patients. It therefore makes far more sense for a healthcare entrepreneur to build hospitals in cities rather than rural areas. It is a sad situation ? while Government healthcare facilities are non-existent in rural areas, there are no incentives to build private hospitals either. Consequently, rural people are forced to live without healthcare services. Do their lives have no value?To address this issue, the upcomingBudgetneeds to offer incentives to encourage and empower healthcare entrepreneurs to build hospitals in rural areas. Three steps can be taken: a 10-year tax holiday for new hospitals in villages and rural areas; accelerated depreciation (100% in the first year itself); and zero GST for life-saving medical equipment used in setting up rural hospitals.This will ensure that growth of healthcare facilities is not focused on cities alone, but also spreads to hinterland India. Once the regulatory ecosystem favours setting up hospitals in rural areas, the challenge of healthcare access can be successfully met.The author is chairman of Meenakshi Mission Hospital & Research Centre, Madurai, Tamil Nadu']",/budget/article/budget-2018-health-care-sector-needs-sops-to-set-up-hospitals-in-villages-118013101209_1.html

The Sensex and Nifty soared to record highs after a bout of volatility at start. The IMF projected a 7.4 per cent and 7.8 per cent growth rate for India in 2018 and 2019 respectively. This makes India one of the fastest-growing country among emerging economies. All this just ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi?s address at a roundtable of 40 CEOs of global companies at the annual World Economic Forum where he said India means business and presented an exciting opportunity for global businesses. The outlook is a smart start. Volatility could remain ahead of the F&O adjustments on Thursday. US markets ended higher after the three-day government shutdown ended.

While the government is widely expected to overshoot the FY18 target, the math still seems workable for maintaining next year?s mark. It?s pertinent to note that it would still be among the lowest deficit levels in last three decades.On the latter, in what?s a recurring pre-budgetfear each year, there?s a possibility of the government maintaining status quo. But if it decides to address the issue, we hope it tries to revise and align taxes, not merely add yet another income source.On the spending front, notwithstanding the fact that we are just 15 months away from general elections, we expect the finance minister to be categorically pragmatic, focused on asset creation and economy boosting spends like infrastructure and on rejecting wasteful expenditure. In this context, Hon. Prime Minister?s recent media byte sounds reassuringly pro-reform, where he remarked that it?s a popular myth that the common man invariably expects freebies and sops from everybudget.Among other things, thisbudgetcould include crucial measures to make Railways more self-sufficient, stressing on generating internal resources to fund its plans and priorities.The government?s income projections have been consistently plausible in the past few years. This time we expect slightly more aggressive estimates, which the government would strive to meet through widening of tax base and imposing penalties on basis of demonetisation data and high disinvestment income. Overall, we expect a well-balancedBudget.We would also like to underline the fact that theBudgetwon?t be the sole platform for launching reforms and we could see a string of positive measures from the government during the course of the year.']",/budget/article/budget-2018-fm-arun-jaitley-expected-to-show-that-india-means-business-118013101280_1.html

In this context, we expect the government to not deviate from fiscal consolidation although the glide path is likely to be extended for FY18 and FY19 at 3.4% and 3.2% of GDP, respectively.Factors helping fiscal consolidation: Recovery in nominal GDP growth (10.5% in FY19), declining trend of primary deficit due to improved tax buoyancy as tax compliance improves from GST and its spillover effect on direct taxes, and elevated stock markets (higher disinvestments) should allow fiscal deficit to reach 3.2% in FY19. Risks to fiscal deficit ? Sharp increase in oil prices and its impact on aggregate demand, primary deficit, inflation and interest rate.FY18 fiscal slippage largely due to shortfall in revenue: Shortfall from GST collections, telecom spectrum and RBI dividend for FY18 will be made up to some extent by higher disinvestment receipts, additional dividends from RBI and expenditure cut. Extra market borrowings guidance for FY18 is marginal at Rs 200 billion.Bigger challenges to divert attention from introduction of LTCG inbudget2019: Although DMs have LTCG in some form or the other, the picture for EMs is mixed with almost full exemptions (China, Thailand, and Singapore) and partial exemptions with progressive taxation in Brazil. Although we believe LTCG in some form will be introduced eventually, given that the government is grappling with larger issues like revival of growth, job creation, rural stress etc., it is unlikely that a measure which dampens investor sentiment will be implemented inbudget2019.Equity market volatility is the lowest in last 10 pre-budgetperiods: Market volatility in the pre-budgetperiod is the lowest as compared to the past 10 budgets indicating that unless thebudgetsprings up a huge surprise in terms of a surge in fiscal deficit estimate or a regressive measure such as a retrospective LTCG regime, market volatility will remain subdued postbudget.Gross borrowing program for FY19 at Rs 6 trillion: We expect FY19 fiscal deficit to be Rs 5.9 trillion and given the redemption of government bonds worth Rs 2.1 trillion in FY19 and estimated borrowings from external financing and small savings instruments at Rs 2 trillion, the gross market borrowing will be Rs 6 trillion (Rs 3.9 trillion net borrowing) for FY19.FY19budgetto focus on boosting overall growth, job creation and alleviating rural stress with an eye on upcoming elections: We expect government to focus on measures targeted at: (a) improved allocation towards productive capital expenditure and infrastructure development including affordable housing; (b) protecting and enhancing farmer?s income; (c) improving agricultural productivity; (d) wider access to finance for marginal farmers at low interest rates; (e) social sector including health and education; (f) rural non-farm income.']",/budget/article/budget-2018-to-be-presented-amid-several-key-challenges-icici-securities-118013101360_1.html

Government remains the key driver of infrastructure creation and one expects the trend to continue in thisbudgetas well. Rural India continues to remain in distress and one expect measures to address discontent and revive sentiments.Measures to shore up revenue baseWith GST Revenues falling short of expectations one expects government to look at alternative ways to boost revenues. Imposition of Long Term Capital Gains tax on Equities will be perceived negatively by equity markets.Risk of a populist tiltWith thisbudgetbeing the last one before national elections there is a risk the government adopts a populist tilt. Given the limited fiscal space and major deterioration in the fiscal deficit may be perceived negatively.By raising the market borrowing in current fiscal, government has made a very clear statement that expenditure cut is not an option. And it seems even more unlikely in next year when the rural distress is taking centre stage ahead of general elections in 2019. So the burden of managing the fiscal math in FY19 will shift to revenue side.Direct tax collections are showing encouraging trend and will likely to remain buoyant with rising tax payers? base. But the uncertainty on indirect taxes will continue in FY19 as the GST system evolves. Our base case is that government will target fiscal deficit of 3.3% to GDP in FY19. However we cannot rule out the possibility of 3% fiscal gap projection with significantly higher disinvestment target.Although the economy is showing early signs of revival, the government will have to be mindful of the challenges emerging from the rising crude oil prices and turning inflation trajectory. Government?s fiscal plans can significantly alter the RBI?s stance over inflation and policy rates. Hence, it will be essential for the government to strike a balance between the fiscal discipline and supporting rural economy.Nilesh Shetty is Associate Fund Manager (Equity Funds) and Pankaj Pathak is Fund Manager ( Fixed Income) and Quantum AMC.']",/budget/article/budget-2018-from-rural-focus-to-corporation-tax-mf-industry-expectations-118013101355_1.html

Which path would the finance minister take? Nitasha Shankar, senior vice-president and head of research, YES Securities, lists herBudget2018-19 expectations.Considering the government?s long term vision as well as the trend set through the earlier budgets, the focus this time is expected to remain largely on housing, infrastructure and the rural economy. Thus, companies catering to these areas should be the key beneficiaries. These include the ones involved in construction, cement, building material (tiles, paints, pipes),housingfinance, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), consumer durables, amongst others.Within infra, areas such as housing, rural connectivity, digital connectivity, metro projects, waterways, sanitation, urban & rural infrastructure, irrigation, and rural electrification are likely to continue to be some of the focus areas, as was seen through the sharp rise in the allocation towards the same in the previousBudget.Within the real estate space, the focus is likely to be on the measures towards boosting the affordablehousingthrough various measures and schemes ? including efforts taken to liquidate inventory in the system as well as providing platforms to raise capital for builders.With the likelihood of thebudgetbeing more on the side of pro-poor, there could be incentives going in the way of the rural economy, including through a focus on job creation. Not to mention that the expectations for tax cuts and lower rates for individuals and corporate both, are high as well. All of these will have a trickledown effect on consumption, and will give a fillip to areas such as farm mechanization, fertilizer usage, auto consumption and NBFCs. These would get a further boost if the government allocates higher amounts towards crop insurance (given its importance) and special focus on rolling out direct benefit transfer (given that it has helped curb the leakage in the system considerably) quicker.The financial services area could be an interesting category to look at as well, especially if the government is looking to increase the focus on long term investing in equities though various schemes - including increasing deductions under section 80c.The author is senior vice-president and head of research, YES Securities']",/budget/article/budget-2018-tightrope-walk-for-jaitley-expect-a-focus-on-housing-infra-118013101340_1.html

The education sector is slated to get its much-needed boost with school education expected to get 14% hike compared to the last year?sbudget.The publishing industry also has big expectations from the government this year, expecting some bold moves.Focus on Infrastructure and Digitization?Digital India? was Prime Minister Narendra Modi?s flagship programme launched in 2014 with a vision to transform India into a ?digitally empowered society and knowledge economy?. It focuses on addressing the issues related to technology in the education sector.Various MNCs have leveraged this to empower students in India, offer skill development programmes, and use technology to reach out to the teachers and youth across the country. For example, Microsoft partnered with 12 state governments to build ICT skills in 8 lakh government school teachers under Project Shiksha. Similarly, Project Saksham is helping bridge the digital gap in higher education institutes, impacting 71 universities by integrating technology into classroom to increase creativity, accelerate learning, and bolster collaboration.However, the structural issues in India?s higher education system are the root cause behind the demand-supply gap in the skill market. Private institutes, which account for two-thirds of higher education in India provide the finest education in the country. However, there are huge barriers for these institutions at every level ? entry, operations, and exit.Restrictions exist on the entry of foreign universities, foreign collaboration, and foreign faculty. Though there is a 100% FDI in the education sector, the clause doesn?t come without riders. According to the FDI policy for the education sector, a foreign entity can invest 100% in India but as a not-for-profit organization. Furthermore, only section 25 companies with no foreign investment can invest in institutes. If the government provides relaxation for these bottlenecks, foreign institutes and companies will be more than willing to invest in exchange programmes, distance education, and faculty exchange programmes with the existing Indian institutes.Tax Rebates for Education LoanThe benefit for eight financial years was introduced in 2006 when the cost of education was not high. However, today, an average four-year engineering course costs INR 8 - 9 lakhs and an average medical degree costs INR 12 ? 14 lakhs. The current interest rates on education loans range from 10.5% to 13.5%. Therefore, an average borrower will most likely need more than eight years to repay the loan. The education sector, including students and parents, are also anticipating relaxation in education loan under Section 80C.Tax reliefIn March 2017, an amendment denied tax relief for higher education institutions; according to Assocham, this must be immediately withdrawn. Furthermore, the chamber has also highlighted that private universities and higher education institutions are facing serious financial challenges related to high capital requirement and non-availability of financial concessions.Higher educational institutes and private companies need enough financial aid to build capacity and solve the tax burden to be able to provide quality education in India. The chamber has additionally suggested to increase the education cess to seek higher public expenditure on education across schools, universities, and advanced institutions.Outlook for publishing sector in the coming years.The government has already slated a higherbudgetfor the education sector this year keeping in mind the concerns related to the growth of education sector. Therefore, it is anticipated that there will be necessary actions in place to provide a boost to the education sector as well as the publishing sector to improve the quality of education, increase the impact of technology, and provide necessary financial reliefs for private institutions. This will help in better foreign collaborations, better outside-in perspective, and a higher student and teacher impact in India.The author is the managing director of Pearson India']",/budget/article/budget-2018-education-sector-expects-its-much-needed-boost-from-fm-jaitley-118013101385_1.html

If the particular supply is being used in the course or furtherance of business, the taxpayers should have opportunity to avail benefit of input credit on such supply.RCM on purchases form Unregistered persons:Although government has postponed the RCM provisions till March 2018, it would be in the interest of taxpayers to remove these provisions or postpone them till people get enough understanding about provisions of law.Input Credit against CGST on pan India basis:The Input credit of CGST should not be restricted to the state where the taxpayer is registered. In the past, it was available across the country on pan-India basis; there was no link to State. Under GST, if a person is not registered in a particular state, input credit of taxes paid in such state is not allowed even if it is on account of CGST. Since CGST is being paid on account of Central Government, taxpayers should get benefit of input credit against CGST paid, irrespective of whether taxpayer is registered in a particular state or not.Reduce GST on products which are likely to benefit the economy:GST on products which will benefit from the overall development of the economy should be reduced or exempted. One such example is insurance products. Currently, life insurance penetration in India is at 3-4%. In the absence of a comprehensive social security mechanism, insurance provides the first layer of financial security and the current tax rate of 18% is making insurance costlier.Talk points for direct taxCommon ManIncrease in basic tax free income:Basic tax free income, which is at present Rs. 2.50 Lacs per annum should be increasedRelief to Salaried Class:Till year 2005, a standard deduction was available to salary class people. If this can be re-introduced, it will have a positive impact on this category of taxpayers. Apart from this an increase in medical allowance will help salaried class people. Medical is one of the necessity and cost of medical facilities have increased, therefore cap of exempt medical allowance may be increasedIncrease in deduction for NPS Contribution:To make NPS more popular and lessen the dependency on social security schemes, amount of deduction for contribution to NPS should be increased.Make tax return filing automatic for individuals:Every year, processes are going to be more and more automized. In line to this, the government can take a step further by sending pre-populated return forms to taxpayers with information from their Form 26AS and other financial transactions linked to their Aadhaar and PAN. The taxpayer should have the option of review and modify before filing. This will save time of taxpayers in filling the form.Business CommunityBoost to Research and Development:Though we are align with the intention of government to reduce corporate tax rate and eliminate all exemptions and deductions. But Research and Development (R&D) is a single area where India needs more and more innovation. An additional deduction for R & D, may continue for at least next 5 years. This will create more opportunities for make in India.Growth for Housing Sector:An increase in amount of interest deduction u/s 23 for self-occupied property (SOP) and an additional deduction to the real estate industry, may give boost to the new projects, especially low cost projects.Benefits to Start-ups:Start-ups are required to be more incentivized.

Though Health care is exempted from goods and services tax (GST), there are other sectoral issues that need to be addressed.From a Diagnostics standpoint, one has firmly supported the need for a standardised, regulated Diagnostics sector and appreciated the Government?s efforts in this direction. Estimates indicate about 1 per cent of all Diagnostic laboratories are accredited.Consequently, the Narendra Modi Government needs to earmark annual allocations for establishing an autonomous body regulating the quality of services. There is an immediate need to build better primary health care centres that would help in reducing the burden on secondary and tertiary health clinics. These primary health care centres should drive awareness programmes to tackle early disease management and reduce the cost burden as well. The nation needs to shift its focus from curative to preventive health care. Accordingly, since diagnostics pave the way and determine the choice of / initiate treatment, the diagnostics industry could be the focal point for driving health care treatment options in the country.In fact, in the National Health Policy 2017, the Government has insisted on the need to strategically invest in preventive health care measures. If the Government invests enough in the Diagnostics segment, the industry can propagate early diagnosis of diseases which in turn has the potential to improve productivity loss and / or delay to onset / eliminate the necessity for tertiary treatment.Private health care manages much of the patient burden spilling from the public health care system. This has boosted many health insurance schemes. The fact, however, is that adequate and comprehensive coverage for a range of services and diseases remains elusive. Curative and invasive interventions, such as surgeries and in-patient care, are covered by public health insurance policies. But despite non-communicable diseases being responsible for more than 50 per cent of all deaths in India, health insurance schemes seem unprepared to meet this disease burden.The absence of coverage for outpatient care and pre-existing diseases is now proving to be an impediment to a comprehensive and affordable health insurance cover. One hopes the Honourable Finance Minister, Arun Jaitley, would find some ways to address the lacuna.The author is CEO of SRL Diagnostics']",/budget/article/budget-2018-govt-must-enable-shift-from-curative-to-preventive-health-care-118013101361_1.html
