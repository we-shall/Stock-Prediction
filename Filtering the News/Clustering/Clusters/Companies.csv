But he doesn?t get much credit for his investment acumen.', 'SoftBank trades well below the value of its assets, including equity in public companies like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Yahoo Japan Corp. The gap has actually widened in recent months to the point SoftBank?s market capitalization is less than half its holdings, worth at least $180 billion. Indeed, SoftBank?s was little changed in the past year, while its stake in Alibaba alone increased by about $60 billion. The stock rose as much as 5.1% in Tokyo on Wednesday ahead of a quarterly earnings announcement.', 'The discount frustrates executives at SoftBank. They track the changes on a weekly basis and are now planning to step up efforts to close the value gap, according to a person familiar with the matter. They plan to make more transparent how the planned $100 billion Vision Fund will benefit SoftBank and how its start-up investments are valued, said the person, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. Investors are desperate for more clarity.', '?The portfolio has grown too broad,? said Mitsushige Akino, an executive officer with Ichiyoshi Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. ?Son needs to make it clear whether this is a telecommunications company or an investment fund.?', 'Since its founding in 1981, SoftBank has grown from a software wholesaler into a global telecom and investment company. Son, who has said the information revolution is SoftBank?s core business, has used earnings from his telecom operations to fund investments in overseas technology companies. Last year, Son formed the Vision Fund, raising $93 billion from big backers including Saudi Arabia and Apple Inc.', 'Son is already examining one step that could clarify his company?s evolution. SoftBank is considering an initial public offering for its mobile phone unit. That would help draw a distinction between the telecom and investment businesses. Plus an IPO would raise capital and allow SoftBank to move some debt onto the phone unit?s books. ?If anyone doubted the company?s direction, an IPO will clarify that,? said Chris Lane, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.', 'It may also shift SoftBank?s investor base. Lane thinks one reason for the valuation gap is that shareholders are still largely telecom investors who want healthy dividend payouts, which SoftBank doesn?t pay. A mobile phone IPO would allow those investors to get the business?and dividends?they want, while technology investors focused on growth could buy into SoftBank Group and its start-up investments. ?Telco investors shouldn?t be buying this stock, tech investors should be buying it,? he said.', 'A second step Son could take to address the value gap is provide detailed information about the Vision Fund. The billionaire made about 100 investments last year and has stakes in preeminent start-ups, such as Uber Technologies Inc., China?s Didi Chuxing and India?s Flipkart Online Services Pvt. But it?s not always clear when SoftBank cuts a deal itself and when the fund does?and how much of each start-up it owns.', 'Investors also want to know the fund?s fee structure, the company?s valuation of investments and how it tracks gains and losses over time, according to Anthea Lai, aBloombergIntelligence analyst. ?For a conglomerate to narrow a discount, it needs to make it easy to value the subsidiaries,? Lai said. ?And the most difficult one to value is the Vision Fund.?', 'SoftBank is planning to improve disclosure surrounding the Vision Fund when it has its final close, now expected in March, the person said, without detailing all the changes.', 'A third step to address the gap would be selling off more investments. SoftBank?s stake in Alibaba alone is worth about ¥15 trillion ($138 billion), far more than SoftBank?s own market value. SoftBank also took a stake of just less than 5% in chipmaker Nvidia Corp. last year, which would be worth more than $6 billion at current prices. Son needs to be more clear about returns on his investments and when shareholders can expect him to sell assets, Ichiyoshi Asset?s Akino said.', 'Such sales would give Son more money for shareholder returns. The most direct route to narrowing the valuation gap would be to purchase the company?s own stock, according to Atul Goyal, an analyst at Jefferies Group. Buying back even 2% of outstanding shares would send a strong message to the market, Goyal said, though he thinks the likelihood is low.', 'SoftBank?s last buyback was in February 2016, when it announced plans to spend as much as ¥500 billion to acquire about 14% of shares. The stock more doubled over the following 12 months, rebounding from a three-year low.', 'In the meantime, Son is showing no sign of slowing down. Last month, the Vision Fund agreed to invest $300 million in Wag Labs Inc., a start-up that uses a smartphone app to connect dog walkers with dog owners, and led an $865 million investment in Katerra Inc., a construction-technology startup seeking to shake up the building industry.', '?Son is looking for something that can become the new core of the company,? Akino said. ?Many investors continue to believe in him, but they want more clarity on where he is heading. And they don?t want to wait too long.?Bloomberg']"

But that?s not stopping its managing director and chief executive officer Kenichi Ayukawa from continuing with his plans to revamp the company. In an interview, Ayukawa comments on the challenges he faces, the continuing dominance of Maruti and whether that is a result of stronger fundamentals or weak rivals. Edited excerpts:', 'Under your stint, Maruti has strengthened all the verticals, signs of which are visible in your earnings and market share. But, the company still seems to be weak on the technology front amid changing industry dynamics.', 'You say you have some concern about the technology development in the company. But, if we cannot do, we cannot survive. We have to do something to catch up with the requirement and demand of customers.', 'What is it that the consumers want in the next five to seven years?', 'Customers demand is changing very fast. Any time, they want an affordable and good product... that is a basic. With the economic situation in the country changing, minds of customers are also changing. We have to find out what they are expecting. But affordability continues to be a very important aspect. That remains the bottom line of the Indian market.', 'Will it be possible to maintain this kind of pricing level amid changes in emission norms, safety norms, which will increase cost?', 'Obviously, with new regulations, we will have new technology, which will increase costs. That could be very challenging. How we are going to compensate for that is another challenge for us any time. But, everybody is facing the same difficulty.', 'If the prices go up, will buyers postpone their purchase decisions?', 'That is a concern for everybody. If we add additional cost to the price... practically it is very difficult for the customers to accept that.', 'Indian industry has a tagline?small is beautiful. Do you think that will stay?', 'I believe so. People understand that there is no need to spend additional money for a bigger car. Small is beautiful and good enough for a product.', 'Will you be able to maintain your market share?', 'We will try to maintain our market share. Nobody wants to see any reduction in volumes and we are not much concerned about the target of maintaining the market share. We try to expand our business across the country. Hence, eventually or fortunately we are getting additional market share.', 'Maruti is the only company that is growing in the country. What differentiates you?', 'As far as Maruti is concerned, the company is looking at the Indian market first. That?s why we always develop products that the Indian customers want and that is very important. Other players are looking at other markets as well. They bring products which are suitable to other markets, here... That is one of the differences, I believe. We are based here and should manufacture products which will match the Indian customer demand. That is a very important point. If you think why Maruti Suzuki has been successful?that has been a key point. That?s why everyday we are focusing on the change in the Indian customer?s expectation two or five years down the line.', 'So, what is the reason for the success of Maruti? A stronger Maruti or a weaker competition.', 'I don?t know about the competitor but the thing that we must do is to match the market and that?s why our products will be accepted by the customers, in terms of price quality and features. Also the customers select us because of the network as well. Our network is stronger than others and any given place they can find our dealer. Even if some problem crops up it can be easily repaired.', 'What are the challenges that Maruti could face in the next 7-10 years?', 'Right now the automobile industry globally is facing a lot of challenges. How it will turn out and whether we will be able to survive or not will be decided after 10-15 years and that is a very critical time, I believe. Everyone is facing the same difficulty, not only us, but also Toyota, Volkswagen and General Motors, etc. Also new players and new entrepreneurs are coming in the industry in different times. Mechanically producing a vehicle is not easy, it?s not like a computer. Also there are safety concerns associated with a vehicle. If there is some safety-related problem, then it cannot be easily modified like a computer. You cannot just try to fix it and keep the data somewhere else. Cars cannot be repaired in such a way.', 'Have you noticed a change in the attitude of first-time buyers? They seem to be moving towards higher priced products.', 'Simply looking at the model-wise sales, still Alto is number one! Other bigger size vehicles are becoming popular and the first time customers are directly buying the Dzire, Swift or the Baleno. Still there are customers who prefer small cars and we have to take care of those people. Some customers are directly buying the Swift or the Dzire but some are upgrading from Alto, Wagon R to Swift and Dzire or Ciaz. We have these kind of customers and have to take care of them. That is an important point. We have to cover a lot of customers under the Maruti umbrella and that is very important for our industry. Some customers upgrade from motorcycles to a used car and then try to buy a new car. So we have to comprehensively take care of our customers. That?s why we need a small car and a good car and then the second step, third step and so on. That is our strategy.', '']"

Until banks start increasing interest rates, domestic investors have few investment options, he said. Edited excerpts from an interview:', 'What are your initial thoughts on the market crash?', 'We have been saying this for the past year that the markets are overvalued so much to the extent that markets did not have any correlation or drew parallel with the fundamentals.', 'So, from that point of view, a market correction was long overdue.', 'What are the factors that led to the correction? And do you envisage more pain in the future?', 'Why the markets have corrected is one of the easiest and not required discussions one can have at this moment.', 'With regards to ?Will there be any more correction??, a 5-6% correction at this point does not bring the market back to its fair value.', 'The Indian markets are still 15-20% overvalued, but that does not mean that the markets will correct by that much. Markets have stayed overvalued for the past one year and they will remain overvalued for some more time to come.

So, no lesson can be drawn just yet. We need to wait for the dust to settle and the whole thing to play out before we can say that we need to learn from the crash.', 'Do you think that other asset classes have become more attractive? If yes, then which ones?', 'This is not just an equity crash but a bigger correction has been in the bond markets. The g-sec (government securities) yields have increased from 6.3% to 7.6-7.7% in six months.  So clearly, the bigger correction is in the bond markets. This is the case both in India and abroad and commodities have rallied in the meantime. So, the two biggest financial asset classes have pulled back. But it is difficult to say whether the correction has bottomed out as yet.', 'Gold historically has a negative correlation with equities; if equity sees a downturn, then gold is a safe harbour asset.', 'Do you think domestic institutional investors (DIIs) which invested a mere Rs400 crore in Indian equities so far this year, may go slow going ahead as well?', 'As yet, I do not see any major decision change in domestic investing; going forward, it is not evident where the DIIs will invest or how they will invest. Real estate or bonds do not look particularly reassuring in their prospects. Until the banks start hiking rates, domestic investors have a challenge in terms of sectors where they can invest.', 'Typically, how much do domestic factors contribute in a rally or a downturn such as this? Is it that domestic factors matter more in a rally, and global factors weigh more in a downturn?', 'We should not speculate on why markets have corrected or gone up.', 'Look at the market fundamentally, focus on valuation. Markets were overvalued a week ago, they are still overvalued by 15-20%. Whether the reason for correction is domestic or global is immaterial.', 'Should the Indian markets move towards defensive sectors?', 'It is hard to pinpoint a defensive sector, in a broadly over-valued market. But IT and FMCG were trading at fairer levels for most of last year. There are still opportunities in large cap IT stocks and pharma stocks are largely neglected.', 'So, there are prospects in some large cap pharma stocks that have suffered a beating in the past one year.', 'There are some CASA- funded banks that are trading at one times their price, decent quality private and public sector banks that one can look at.', 'Nasrin Sultana contributed to this story.']"

On Tuesday afternoon, he watched the private rocket company that he runs, SpaceX, successfully launch its first Falcon Heavy. On Wednesday afternoon, Wall Street will watch as the public automaker that he runs, Tesla Inc., reports fourth quarter earnings.', 'Information-starved investors will be on high alert, as will hundreds of thousands of would-be drivers waiting for Tesla to produce and deliver their new electric cars. They must be optimistic: Shares were up as much as 3.6% in New York, the biggest intraday move in almost a month.', 'Here are five key questions to ask as a way to gauge Tesla?s prospects going into a decisive year.', 'How many Model 3s can Tesla actually produce?', 'The more affordable Model 3 sedan is the linchpin of Tesla?s attempt to transition from niche automaker to high-volume manufacturer, and the ramp-up so far has been muted. The first wave of cars has been delivered to paying customers, but Tesla has delayed targets several times to focus on quality and play whack-a-mole with several unspecified production bottlenecks at both its Gigafactory in Nevada and its assembly plant in California.', 'Tesla said in January that it expects a more gradual production ramp through the first quarter and intends to achieve the 5,000-per-week milestone by late June, three months later than previous guidance?and even that was already delayed a quarter. The company hasn?t yet clarified whether a 10,000-per-week run rate is still possible this year. When that question came up back in November, Musk answered with a 12-second pause.', 'Investors will be watching closely for any indication that output goals have slipped again, and any news on 2018 full-year targets and de-bottlenecking efforts will be welcome. Also avidly interested will be many of the hundreds of thousands of would-be buyers who put down $1,000 deposits, starting almost two years ago, to reserve Model 3s.', 'How far off are the long-awaited updates to Tesla?s autonomous features?', 'Musk vowed to demonstrate a completely autonomous Los Angeles-to-New York trip by the end of 2017?a feat that hasn?t yet happened. Investors and enthusiasts alike know that the chief executive officer?s timelines are often overly aggressive. But with autonomous driving now as hot as electrification?General Motors Co. vehicles are improving fast, and Alphabet Inc.?s Waymo plans to start ferrying paying passengers in Phoenix this year?there will be renewed focus on Tesla?s driverless program.', 'Things have not been smooth within the Autopilot team at Tesla. Two leaders departed in roughly the past year, and staff has suffered from inevitable talent churn. It doesn?t help that Chris Lattner, who led the team from January 2017 until June, recently got his Model 3 and threw some shade via Twitter about lack of progress on Autopilot. Tesla also recently disclosed that it didn?t test any autonomous cars on California?s public roads last year, even as Waymo churned up more than 352,000 miles.', 'Tesla charges customers $5,000 for an option called ?Enhanced Autopilot? and an additional $3,000 for an option called ?Full Self-Driving Capability.? Close observers can?t help but wonder: Does Tesla, which doesn?t use lidar, have the hardware necessary to deliver on its promises? The goal, as Musk has said, is nothing less than full self-driving mode in almost all circumstances. And what ever happened to Musk?s plan to take on Uber Technologies Inc. with the ?Tesla Network? of shared autonomous rides?', 'Have customer deposits become a major revenue stream?', 'In an unusual way for automakers to raise cash, Tesla takes deposits from customers for products that have been unveiled but are not yet in production. That amounted to a staggering $686 million on the books at the end of the third quarter, much of that from down payments for the Model 3 sedan. And in November, Tesla unveiled not just one but two new vehicles: an electric Semi truck and a next-generation Roadster sports car.', 'Deposits for the Semi and the Roadster could add a further $300 million to Tesla?s working capital, according to UBS analyst Colin Langan, and clearing inventory could add $400 million. With reservations for the ?Founders? series Roadster running at $250,000 each, could this be the moment when deposits approach $1 billion?', 'Investors would especially love to see Tesla break out deposits by vehicle, as well as for other products, including the Powerwall home battery and new solar roof. That?s something the company hasn?t previously done.', 'Is Tesla making any progress on getting into China?', 'Tesla said in November that it remains about three years from starting production in the world?s largest auto market, although Musk warned that the timeline could slip. ?Don?t set your watch by this,? Musk told an analyst at the time, calling his estimate of the wait until production starts a ?rough target.?', 'Still, Tesla?s factory needs are vast and growing. The company is bursting at the seams at its auto plant in Fremont, California, and is still building out its Gigafactory near Reno, Nevada. The company has not said where it will make its Semi truck or the new Roadster. Will Tesla expand domestic manufacturing capacity before committing to China? Or is China still top of the list?', 'India hasn?t given up its hopes of wooing the automaker, either. India?s transport minister, Nitin Gadkari, has promised to roll out the red carpet for Musk, offering land and other help to attract a Tesla plant.', 'How fast is all that cash burning?', 'Tesla was burning through $8,000 a minute last year, according toBloombergcalculations, and the slower ramp-up of the Model 3 means there?s less cash coming in the door. But the company has always been creative about financing and just sold $546 million of auto lease-backed bonds. The question looming large for Wall Street: Just how long can Tesla go before it returns to the equity or debt markets? Most analysts expect a $2 billion to $3 billion capital raise sometime this year, though the forecast as to timing is still up in the air.', '?While we believe Tesla will be able to fund the Model 3 ramp without raising additional capital, we think a raise would remove an overhang on the stock,? analyst Ben Kallo of Robert W. Baird wrote in a note.', 'Musk has had no trouble accessing the market in the past, and his new proposed pay package would help ensure he stays around to hit Tesla?s aggressive growth targets. With SpaceX?plus OpenAI, Neuralink and Boring Co.?all vying for Musk?s attention, Tesla is trying to keep its chief executive officer and largest shareholder close for the next decade.Bloomberg']"

Why are you averse to bringing the technology to India?', 'We make more than one-and-a-half million electric vehicles in the world but I think it?s the wrong thing for India. Our long-term requirements are better fuel efficiency because we need to reduce oil imports, a cleaner environment and more safety. These three things are needed to survive long-term in the mobility game. Look at all the studies on emissions and efficiency. You can reduce energy consumption if the overall system is more efficient.', 'Data from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, based on Indian driving cycles, fuel systems and electricity production, shows that hybrids are the most efficient for the environment and energy consumption. While India?s capacity to produce electricity from renewable sources is about 70%, actual production is about 90% coal-based. On that basis, EVs produce far more emissions than a hybrid.

For this, I must give credit to Toyota. The same best-in-class safety standards apply to their cars no matter where they sell them.', 'What?s the update with Lexus?', 'Sales have just begun with the whole range up for sale. They are priced quite high, but there is still a market for such vehicles. It shows the level of technology which we can aspire to have in all our cars, within Toyota.
