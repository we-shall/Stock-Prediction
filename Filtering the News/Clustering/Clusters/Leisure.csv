It affects over 20% people globally at some point. Studies suggest that approximately 1% of the world?s population may have chronic migraine. While it is a genetic disorder, environment, lifestyle, diet and hormonal imbalances can play a large role in how often you suffer from it.', 'Individuals with migraine can feel completely drained. It can manifest itself as a pulsating or throbbing ache on one or both sides of the head. Patients may also experience nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to sound and light, even pressure on the eyes. Severe migraine can be debilitating, hampering day-to-day functioning. In most cases, the ordeal lasts several days.', 'When it comes to living with migraine, what you eat can make a big difference. Often, patients notice that their migraines are triggered, or symptoms worsened, by the foods they eat. However, the foods or ingredients that can contribute to migraine vary widely.', 'Some people get more migraine attacks after drinking alcohol, especially beer and wine, while others have more frequent migraines if the gap between meals is long. It is worth examining your eating habits to identify patterns that could check the attacks. In some cases, migraine can also be triggered by exposure to sun, stress, lack of sleep, etc.', 'While medication can ease the pain, lifestyle and dietary modifications can also help in relieving and preventing pain. Here are a few things you can do.', 'Isolate and identify the triggers with the help of an ?elimination and challenge? diet. Don?t cut out all your potential trigger foods at once, else you will not be able to find out what your trigger is. This can also lead to stress, which can compound your symptoms.', 'To analyse your triggers, maintain a migraine diary. It will help you keep track of any changes you are making to your diet, and note how severe and frequent your headaches are. For any single food to qualify as a potential trigger, a headache should occur within 24 hours of its consumption. Common triggers include alcohol, artificial sweeteners, caffeine withdrawal, processed meats and foods containing monosodium glutamate, histamines and tyramines found in some aged cheese and chocolates, cured meats, smoked fish, yeast extract and food preservatives that contain nitrates and nitrites. The list is long.', 'Be careful, however, about trying out extremely strict diets. for you may end up avoiding foods that are not necessarily migraine triggers?and you may be missing out on important nutrients in the bargain.', 'If you record at least three attacks caused by a food item, remove it from your diet for a month. If that helps lessen the attacks, abolish it from your diet. Reintroducing a ?trigger? is a good way to confirm that it continues to be one after abstinence, and is therefore worth withdrawing from completely. Strict elimination diets should only be done under medical supervision.', 'Non-dietary triggers such as stress, poor sleep quality and too much sunlight can all exacerbate migraine. Often, it is a combination of all of these factors.', 'Consult a doctor and check whether it would be a good idea to take magnesium supplements. These can help in muscle relaxation and promote sleep.  Also, do get your iron and vitamin D levels checked?if these are low, they can cause headaches.', 'Vishakha Shivdasani is a Mumbai-based medical doctor with a fellowship in nutrition. She specializes in controlling diabetes, cholesterol and obesity.']"

Their concern that the switch to four-wheel drive could corrupt the new M5?s driving experience is dispelled\u2002instantly. The M5?s 4.4-litre V8 now gets bigger turbos and higher injection pressure, among other tweaks, boosting power to a supercar-humbling 600hp.', 'The new M5?s engine is an evolution over its predecessor and comes with a substantial 8.5% increase in power and 10.3% more torque to take performance to a different level. BMW claims a 0-100 kmph time of a staggering 3.4 seconds, a good 1 second faster than the older car. Who would have imagined a four-door sedan being capable of these figures? There?s very little lag from the pair of turbos, and you get a brutal, linear shove when you press the throttle.', 'Another big change in the new M5 is the transmission. BMW has ditched the previous car?s dual-clutch unit and gone in for a torque converter?ZF?s eight-speed Steptronic, which has the reputation of being smooth, quick and efficient. The older dual-clutch units can be a bit rough at lower speeds.', 'The only disappointment is the engine sound which, though loud, is a bit underwhelming. It lacks the soulful tone of the Merc AMG V8s and doesn?t burble like a Jaguar either.', 'You appreciate the layer of security the four-wheel drive brings, and the predictable handling goads you to push on a road that?s not much wider than the 1,903mm width of the sedan. BMW says it has reduced weight, but it has gone down only by 15kg.', 'In 4WD Sport mode, the car feels wonderfully neutral. There?s a hint of under-steer which disappears in the more aggressive Sport+ and M Dynamic modes. This masterful rear-wheel-drive adjustability is thanks to some clever software, which seamlessly controls all the parameters of the M xDrive, or four-wheel-drive system. The grip from the Pirelli P Zeros instils huge confidence.', 'The M5 rides on 20-inch alloys and is very compliant on broken roads? that will be a big plus in India. There?s no reason why the M5 can?t do the job of a BMW 530i sedan. Sure, there are the muscular wheel arches, side skirts, massive air intakes in the front, a rear diffuser and quad exhausts, but these exterior bits are packaged quite subtly.', 'The interiors too are similar to a regular 5-series, with the dashboard largely being carried over. You do get a sportier steering wheel and seats, and carbon-fibre inserts, but not at the expense of features and comfort. There is a 16-speaker Bowers & Wilkins sound system and a 360-degree camera. The radar-based safety kit may not make it to India because of restrictions on radar frequencies.', 'What you certainly can?t have is a sunroof. For BMW engineers, a sunroof in the M5 is anathema as it would put extra weight in the worst possible place?the roof.', 'The 2018 M5 will wear a price tag upwards of Rs1.5 crore (ex-showroom). And you will get manic performance that doesn?t come at the expense of everyday usability.']"

Several hundreds of her adoring fans had been in attendance the evening before when Rupi Kaur performed on the front lawns of the venue, their shrieks and hoots more suited to a rock concert than poetry reading. Later, at a private party, a well-known poet had cornered me. ?People were actually shouting out requests of their favourite poems!? she said with a touch of exasperation. ?Whatisit that makes them go crazy??', 'What indeed, I wonder, as I wait for my turn in the snaking queue of journalists, armed with cameras, notebooks and smartphones, the next day. The sun is high, mid-morning ennui has planted the thought of lunch in many. As the interviewers fidget, exchanging banter about Rupi Kaur?s poetry, a man in a suit and turban, sitting close by, casts wary glances in their direction. He is, we would learn later, Rupi Kaur?s father, accompanying her on her multi-city tour in India. Apparently, it was one of his poems, written to his wife many moons ago, that inspired the title of his daughter?s best-selling debut,Milk And Honey.', 'After over an hour?s delay, I finally make my way into the hallowed chamber where Rupi Kaur has been ensconced all morning, speaking to the media in bite-sized slots. She looks fresh?ebullient, focused, convivial. As I pull out my recorder, she begins to stroll around the room. I follow her with my questions. I have precisely 10 minutes to crack the mystery of Rupi Kaur.', 'The day before, I had watched online her TED talk about surviving sexual abuse. In a bravura performance of nearly 20 minutes, her voice changes inflection several times. From melodrama to incantation to the fuzzy, new-age-y commentary one hears on meditation apps, she delivers every sentence with the right punch.', 'Just how does she do this?grab our attention, whether we like her poems or not?', '?I?m a very empathetic person to a fault, my Dad will tell you,? Rupi Kaur tells me. ?I see somebody remotely having a bad day and suddenly I?m on the floor crying.? At that moment, she looks invulnerable. Not a hair out of place, a beatific smile plastered on her face, she has the demeanour of someone who has sold over 2.5 million copies of her first book?one that she self-published before a big publisher picked it up?and which then stayed on theThe New York Timesbest-seller list for over 50 consecutive weeks. Her second volume of poems,The Sun And Her Flowers, published last year, has only cemented the incredible cult around her.', 'It?s not easy to be Rupi Kaur though. ?Readers who have met me for, like, 30 seconds share the most intense story about their lives,? she says. ??My mom died last week and your poems helped me so much!? I?m like, dude, that?s a conversation that needs two cups of hot tea and maybe a couple of hours!? With over 2.2 million followers on Instagram, she can?t afford to dwell on her notifications (?I don?t have social media on my phone, for the sake of my health?). A team manages her accounts, filtering thousands of mentions on every platform each day.', '', 'Rupi Kaur?s style isn?t unique. Fellow poets like Nayyirah Waheed, who accused her of plagiarism, Lang Leav, Warsan Shire, Atticus and Nikita Gill give her close competition in terms of popularity. (The plagiarism controversy fizzled away, the similarities between their styles were incidental, even inescapable, given their formulaic approach to poetry. ) Then there are the ?haters?, who deplore her writing as an affront to ?real? poetry. Still, it?s not hard to see what makes her tick among her largely millennial audience.', 'Set aside your lofty tastes and read these lines: ?i do not need the kind of love/ that is draining/ i want someone/ who energises me.? Then ask any random sample of users of dating apps what they are looking for. You?ll most likely hear a version of this poem in their answers. Whether they sing it out in Shakespearean cadence or intone it in Rupi Kaur?s glib obviousness, the sentiment is the same. We are all broken. We need love. And some of us would rather hear this from Rupi Kaur than Robert Frost. To each their own.', 'Or sample this: ?i won?t let go cause/ being alone hurts more/ than chasing someone who?s left/ but if you?ve left/ aren?t i already alone/ and surviving it.? Between the visceral directness of this poem and, say, Wendy Cope?s profound witticisms, which one do you imagine will most likely speak to a restless teenager, whose heart is wobbly like Jell-O from a break-up and their body a tsunami of hormones?', 'Has Rupi Kaur, then, liberated poetry from the fetters of snobbery? Yes, if the evidence of her sales is anything to go by. Does her success pose a threat to poetry as we conventionally know it?an elevated, complex and sophisticated mode of expression? Not really. Big trade publishing has long ignored the latter, the appearance of a Rupi Kaur is hardly going to deter them from promoting new and emerging ?serious? poets.', 'Rupi Kaur is pragmatic, even self-protective, regarding the barrage of criticism heaped on her. ?You can?t control what people say about you,? she says. ?Even if I fixed the things they complain about, they will find something else to blame me for.? The problems of being Rupi Kaur are indeed many. She has been slammed for manipulating readers with her outré racial and gender politics?an ?infamous? portrait of her menstruating in bed caused a mini-scandal. But her ardent admirers don?t care what future PhD scholars are going to make of her. To the Rupi-groupie, she will be their new-age Rumi?at least for the foreseeable future?a steady supplier of 2-minute instant comfort when they are in the dumps.']"

The latest in this is the gallery?sIndia?s French Connection: Indian Artists in Franceat the Visual Arts Gallery in the India Habitat Centre in New Delhi. Running from 1-11 February, this compact and visually stunning exhibition of 25 Indian artists features a selection of modern masters like Amrita Sher-Gil, Jogen Chowdhury, SH Raza, Sakti Burman and Ram Kumar, among others. The artists? engagements with Paris was varied, from long sojourns to brief dalliances. However, the artworks presented here distil those engagements into highly individual statements.', 'A very interesting facet of the selections is the way they capture unique moments in the careers of the artists. For instance, Ram Kumar?s 1963 oil on canvas work of a city waterfront calledUntitled, is a snapshot of a moment of transition for the Bombay Progressive Artists? Group luminary. His stylistic progression from figuration to abstraction is well known, and this painting captures the artist in the middle of making that move. This is juxtaposed brilliantly with another untitled work from 1961, which is a pure meditation on colour.', 'Others, like two of Sakti Burman?s paintings from the early 70?s, capture a moment when the artist?s style was still evolving. His 1975 oil on canvas,The Wait, is a large, marvellous work that exudes a surreal, fey quality, with its depicted human and animal figures existing in some wonderland of the mind. The marbling effect that he?s known for is in evidence in the fresco-like treatment of his works here. Jehangir Sabavala?s 1950 oil on canvas painting,Still-Life with Apples, is a lyrical impressionistic piece from an artist known more for his cubist works.', '', 'There are three sculptures featured in the exhibition, including a bronze piece by Prodosh Dasgupta from 1990 calledQueen Reclining. It recalls European pre-historic sculptures of female ?mother earth? figurines with its small breasts and a large lower body. The piece also plays with perspective, creating an effect of languor and ease.', 'Amrita Sher-Gil was the first of the exhibited artists to go to Paris, where she trained under the French painter Lucien Simon at the École Nationale des Beaux-Arts. Her warm and peaceful oil on canvas painting,View from Studio(1934) is a clear example of taking what she learnt of the European masters and using it to create something original.', 'With the riches on display,India?s French Connectionrewards the viewer for time spent at the exhibition. Designed by French scenographer Adrian Gardère, each individual artists? works has been afforded a lot of breathing space at the show, with about 3 works exhibited per artist. DAG has also published a satisfyingly lavish book to go with the exhibition, which contains many more works which couldn?t be accommodated in the Visual Arts Gallery. DAG?s CEO Ashish Anand considers this to be the best show that the gallery has ever put together. ?Each work has been very carefully chosen. It looks better, and we could better contain everything,? Anand says. In a short film made for the exhibiton, art historian Dr. Devika Singh stresses that for the artists, ?Paris is not so much a place of imitation, as a place of experimentation. They come here and what they find is their personal voice.?', '', 'DAG is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year, andIndia?s French Connectionkicks off a week of intense art-related events from the gallery, including talks by Bernard Ruiz-Picasso, the co-founder of the Museo Picasso Málaga (7 February); Jean-Marc Bustamante, Principal of the École Nationale des Beaux-Arts (8 February) and Catherine Chevillot, Director of the Rodin Museum in Paris (10 February). You can watch these talks live on DAG?s Facebook page. Also look out for DAG?s exhibitionNavratna: India?s National Treasure Artistsat the gallery?s booth at the India Art Fair. There?s also the ongoing exhibition of the works of Altaf Mohammedi at DAG?s Hauz Khas gallery,Altaf-A Retrospective(on till 31 March).']"

A few weeks ago, Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah became my hero when he responded to Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath?s bovine-related electoral posturing with these lines: ?A lot of Hindus eat beef. If I want to eat, I will, who are they to tell me not to consume beef? I don?t eat beef only because I don?t like to.? In recent times at least, I can?t recall the head of any other Indian state speaking up for the freedom to decide what we put on our plate. I?m as vegetarian as the self-proclaimed ?purest? Hindu but my politics is liberal?I believe nobody has the right to police what I eat/wear and whom I love?so you can understand why I was thrilled to hear him say this.', 'My criterion for identifying new heroes in an increasingly divided India is simple: Heroes spread love, not hate.', 'So the district magistrate of Bareilly, Raghvendra Vikram Singh, made the cut after a riot in Kasganj when he said: ?Muslims living here are our brothers. We have the same blood running in our veins. We share the same DNA.? And I?m a fan of the 67 retired civil servants who wrote to the prime minister asking him to take ?firm action against perpetrators of hate crimes?.', 'Back in the day, becoming a hero was hard work. It wasn?t enough to mouth a few dialogues that would make columnists such as myself happy. You actually had to do stuff. I?m writing this just after the 70th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi?s assassination. Gandhi was on the side of love but he also had to invent a philosophy of non-violent resistance, help throw out the British, go on several hunger strikes, be imprisoned multiple times, brave mobs, walk 200 miles at a time and give his life in the service of the nation before we anointed him our hero.', 'Not many can compete with Gandhi,  of course, but modern-day political heroes are lucky we focus more on what they say rather than what they do.', 'On a stage in Bengaluru last week, some of my new and old heroes gathered to commemorate the late activist Gauri Lankesh on her birthday. Lankesh, a fierce critic of Hindu extremists and editor of a Kannada weekly, was murdered at her Bengaluru home last September by as-yet unidentified people.', 'Old heroes on stage included 99-year-old H.S. Doreswamy, a freedom fighter who has been speaking up against the establishment since before 1947. ?We should not allow the Bharatiya Janata Party to win Karnataka. This is the time for all secular forces to unite to defeat our common enemy,? he told the gathering. The other, pre-digital-era heroes present that day included Irom Sharmila, who made it to our consciousness because she protested against Afspa (the Armed Forces Special Powers Act) in Manipur by going on a hunger strike for 16 years, and Teesta Setalvad, whose work after the 2002 Gujarat riots has resulted in more than 120 convictions. All good old-fashioned doers who toiled hard to be our heroes.', 'Then there was the new, vocal gang described by a friend as ?the real opposition? because they are certainly more outspoken critics of the government than the assorted representatives of other political parties that sit in Parliament. The motley group of dissenters has been termed anti-national by many, but they were clearly heroes in that room. Heroes who have the ability to go viral.', 'There was Kanhaiya Kumar and his compatriots Umar Khalid and Shehla Rashid. Kumar?s historic speech on the Jawaharlal Nehru University campus one night in 2016 was telecast live by most television channels and upstaged the prime minister?s speech in newspaper headlines the next day. That night, Kumar riffed on the idea ofazadiand said, famously, ?We are not seeking freedom from India butinIndia.?', 'There was Kannada actor and dissenter Prakash Raj, who has spoken out on everything fromPadmaavatto the gruesome murder of a Muslim man in Rajsamand. He has often said that he only started speaking after his friend was murdered. ?When Gauri is killed, I am created. Why me? I knew Gauri for 35 years. But when they killed her, I realized I didn?t know her,? he said on her birthday.', 'Jignesh Mevani, who went from vocal critic to political opposition when he recently contested and won in the Gujarat assembly polls, said he would work to consolidate the Dalit vote in Karnataka and reiterated the most popular message in that auditorium: Unite and fight the BJP. That day, the new heroes did what they are best at?give fiery, anti-establishment speeches about brotherhood and defeating divisive forces.', 'So, is it a good thing or a bad thing that to be a hero in our eyes these days all you have to do is speak up for personal freedom or against hate?

This is the only line which is not a joke in this act, which had garnered 7,304,809 views on YouTube when I watched it earlier this week. I peer closely at the number to make sure it is actually 7.3 million. After all the jokes about the shape, size, song and even the groping of breasts on Mumbai?s locals, Mittal leaves the audience with a single takeaway. A heightened awareness of the risk of breast cancer.', 'I?ve been chatting, texting and talking to Aditi Mittal for over a year now. Sometimes we are friends exchanging notes, sometimes I am interviewing her, and most of the time I am trying to join the dots. What makes Mittal, one of India?s most popular stand-up comics with her own hour-long Netflix show, so preposterous and yet so resonant with audiences? She locates her jokes in the most uncomfortable moments in one?s life, and makes us laugh. And then think.', 'We have spoken about mothers who have the same one-liners and brothers we get along with best when they are a few continents removed from us.', '?In a clean, straightforward way, you exist in the years between my daughters and me,? I type in the chat window, trying to articulate my fascination with observing Mittal. Even more than her performances, I watch her off-stage, keenly following her outspoken, self-deprecatory avatar on Twitter and Facebook. I also sense a vulnerability and want to reach there with her.', '?What I love about my job is how it makes me live for a living. I have to reallylive, and immerse myself so I have something authentic to talk about on stage,? Mittal says as we talk about her influences. ?And when I can bring the uncurated, real me on to the stage, the act always works. That?s my best preparation.?', 'In the middle of last year, Mittal?s father died after a brief illness. I send her a message a few days later. ?I want to fly to wherever you are and laugh and cry with you a little.?', 'She gets back after a few hours. ?No crying,? she says. ?He outclassed everyone else in death. So laughing is all that is left in this life.?', 'I send her a red heart emoticon in the chat window. She replies with two words. ?True story.?', '?I believe you, Aditi,? I say.', 'Mittal stresses on the privileges she has enjoyed, but she is also shaped by the unconventional life she has lived. Mittal?s mother died when she was three years old. Her older brother and she have been brought up jointly by her aunt, a single woman, and her father, who never married again. The children had two homes to call their own. Mittal refers to her aunt as Mom, and her stage acts are full of jokes at her expense.', '?My Mom?s mad, she is never pleased with anything,? Mittal tells me. ?I hope I never please her fully. I don?t know what a look of approval looks like, and I don?t want to see it either.?', '?But children usually resent this in their parents,? I say.', '?My Mom?s too funny. She doesn?t give a hoot. After she saw my first performance, her friend had so much feedback and praise for me. But Mom was just like, let?s leave quickly, we don?t want our car to be stuck in traffic now. Mom taught me to bebindaas(carefree),? says Mittal. ?Sometimes when my friends say, my Mom loved your show, that?s the best badge of honour for me.?', 'On another day, we chat about the use of personal stories in our work. ?I am fascinated by truth-tellers,? says Mittal. ?There are people whose work makes me pause and say, oh, he or she has revealed this also? They have said what we had assumed was unutterable.?', 'She recalls with much hilarity her memories of a schoolfriend?s grandmother, who used to yell at others with great abandon. ?I love older women,? says Mittal. ?Their giving-a-fuck filter is gone. They don?t want to seem seductive to anyone any more. I was inspired to create the character of Dr Mrs Lutchuke from watching this grandmom, who could chase you down the street if she wanted something from you. This character, with bad posture and a worse mood, allowed me to say so much on stage. I didn?t have to be Aditi Mittal saying outrageous things. I could step into the skin of the crazy Lutchuke woman and distance myself from her behaviour. It?s a fascinating device.?', 'I tell her that whether she cares to accept it or not, she is a role model too. It is inspiring to watch a young, single woman going on stage to perform comedy, using her body, her voice and her words to draw laughter without fear of ridicule. Stating grand truths with a lightness of touch, so the laughs come first and the shock of the revelation settles in later.', '?Raise the standard of your role models, Miss,? Mittal says in her inimitable way. ?Performing stand-up comedy is like an adventure sport,? she adds. ?No two situations are ever the same. You can bungee-jump 10 times to practise, but the risk remains the same each time you perform. If you do badly, you die.', '?There is a symbiotic relationship between the writing of the material and the performing of it. One informs the other. You are under duress when you are performing, you have to be in the moment and adapt according to the energy in that space.?', 'Mittal has a busy schedule and a full calendar. In the last two years, she has debuted at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, presented a show calledA Beginner?s Guide To Indiaon BBC?s Radio 4, released her Netflix comedy special,Things They Wouldn?t Let Me Say,and performed multiple shows every week. She performed 168 shows in 2017, adding new destinations like Hubli, Visakhapatnam, Guwahati, Shillong, Lucknow and Raipur in her itinerary.', '?Shillong was my best audience,? she says. ?Work makes me meet new people and places all the time. I am always learning from watching responses. What made them laugh? What didn?t? Sometimes the late realization on someone?s face?it?s thrilling to observe faces from the stage.?', '?Where do you want to reach?? I ask Mittal. I want to know what seems like the pinnacle of achievement to a stand-up comic.', '?By the mathematical odds, I feel like I have already won a lottery,? she says. ?I am too lucky. Just the fact that I get to do this on a consistent basis is a win for me.? After a pause, she adds, ?I want to do this till I am 90.?', '?Till Dr Mrs Lutchuke and you become the same person,? I say. She laughs at the thought, giving me the thrill of having seemed funny to a comedian again.', 'Because I am so aware of my own inhibitions and roadblocks, I am keen to hear about the fears Mittal grapples with. ?The only way to it, is through it,? she often repeats in our conversations.', '?Naak pakad ke kood jaao(Hold your nose and jump in).

One work to watch out for is1000 Attempts At A Reconciliation, at the projects space, by South Korean artist Timothy Hyunsoo Lee?it is being brought to the fair by the Sabrina Amrani Gallery from Madrid. In this work, the artist has transferred 1,000 sheets of 24-carat gold leaf on to a blue surface to symbolize a story from his childhood?that folding a thousand paper cranes allows an individual to realize one?s wish. Art Space Pool, a Seoul-based non-profit, will introduce a selection of Korean women artists like Bomin Kim and Jang Pa.

According to Kishore Singh, head (publications and exhibitions) at the gallery, this work is from the private collection of Sher-Gil?s paternal family and has never been shown to the public before.

Ostensibly headquartered in Varanasi, with links to London and New York, the ?Society? was actually a work of fiction, born from the minds of a couple of British officials and their associates in faraway India. That the translation, despite its infirmities, was indeed of Vatsyayana?s 1,600-year-old disquisition was not doubted. But even as theKamasutramade its way into the great libraries of the West, the true identity of its translator remained shrouded for years behind this fictitious organization. There were several reasons why Sir Richard Francis Burton was paranoid about advertising his name with the book?British laws on obscenity were so draconian that printing anything even vaguely sexual could show writers the doors to prison. For theKamasutra, then, it took some creative thinking to evade Victorian prudery. The Sanskrit wordyoniwas used in the English text for the vagina, even when Vatsyayana himself never used that word in the actual Sanskrit original. But the gamble paid off?in time, the bogus Kama Shastra Society?s translation would become, as one scholar notes, ?one of the most pirated books in the English language?, registered across the world as the oldest and foremost classical text on all matters pertaining to love and human sexuality. This, even when it wasn?t exactly sincere to Vatsyayana?s moral outlook from centuries before.', 'The loosely held opinion that theKamasutrais a catalogue for boudoir gymnastics also owes much to this context: The pronounced disapproval with which topics around sexuality were viewed meant that its most colourful components acquired, ironically, a life of their own, feelings of taboo fuelling a mischievous appetite for the text. In actual fact, though, theKamasutrais more than a manual for love-making?of the seven books that constitute its body, only the second is strictly concerned with methods of human congress. Burton, bent as he was on ?the sexual liberation of Victorian society?, seems to have highlighted these while watering down other elements. But despite such interventions, even in that first 1883 translation, of 175-odd pages, Burton could devote only 40 to this theme. The remainder of theKamasutra, in fact, offers a much wider series of discussions for the benefit of its wealthy and primarily male audience, covering not only sex but also matters of aesthetics and more.', 'Book 5, for example, concerns itself with extramarital affairs and how one ought to go about getting in bed with another?s spouse, while another section in the same book investigates, tantalizingly but ultimately disappointingly, ?Why Women Get Turned Off?. In Book 1, we learn that if men of culture want to remain men of culture, they must allocate time every five-10 days to the removal of all their body hair. Married women are generally not to be seduced, we are taught, but if it helps to gain influence over a powerful husband or even perhaps to erase him from the world and acquire his wealth, it is acceptable to bed the wife as a weapon for one?s personal ambitions and avarice. In these sections, then, theKamasutramight well have been inspired by cold, calculating Chanakya and his utterly pragmaticArthashastra.', '', 'The writer Hanif Kureishi once similarly noted that theKamasutrais less like Lord Byron?s heady romances and closer to P.G. Wodehouse?s wit in much of its tone. ?One can wager on kisses,? argues Vatsyayana, for ?whichever of the partners first gets to the other?s lower lip wins.? In order to seduce a woman, a man must be prepared to go flower-picking with her, to play in her doll house, and, perhaps most essentially, cultivate her closest friend, who, in an ideal society, is her wet-nurse?s daughter. Where courtesans are concerned, Vatsyayana advises them to avoid by all means patrons with worms in their stool?or whose breath ?smells of crows?. They must also, he warns, never surrender reason, feeling free to manipulate men for money and goods. And if a patron were no longer capable, of providing said money and goods, he was to be discarded. One suggested route was to alienate him with markedly unpleasant behaviour: ?Curling the lip in a sneer? and ?stamping on the ground? promised success, evidently. ?Ignoring him? was also an option.', 'There are, however, parts of theKamasutrathat make for highly uncomfortable reading, especially in this time when #MeToo has sparked such troubled introspection; sections that, as scholar Wendy Doniger notes, seem to justify the seduction-by-sexual-assault school of thinking. So while one can laugh at theKamasutra?s assertion that the male ?instrument? (ideally pierced) smeared with honey, powdered thornapple and black pepper provides divine ecstasies to the female, one cannot quite digest that a man can confidently proceed with intercourse with a woman when ?her mouth says no, but her eyes say yes?. Where at one point he is clear that ?a girl who is asleep, weeping or absent? cannot be a bride, Vatsyayana still allows a wedding technique that involves getting the lady drunk, and taking her ?maidenhead? while she is unconscious. Of course, given its age and context, it is not surprising that theKamasutraspeaks in a male voice with erroneous male preconceptions. Compared to contemporaneous texts like theManusmriti, however, theKamasutrais replete with commentaries by women?and it recognizes the right to pleasure for the female too.', 'Vatsyayana?s approach to the third gender, on homosexuality and bisexuality, also makes for gripping reading (and interpretation), so that in the overall analysis of the work?a very good recent translation being A.N.D. Haksar?s?one feels partly surprised, partly amused, but always certainly interested. For all its sometimes outlandish views on life, marriage and intimacy, theKamasutraremains a thoroughly fascinating work of art and cultural heritage, one we must read for more than a mere list of bedroom positions. That, in the end, is the secret of its enduring appeal', 'Medium Rare is a column on society, politics and history. Manu S.

But a weekend is all I have, so she chalks out a two-day itinerary for me, squeezing in every place that should be on the must-try list. I am both scared and excited at the idea of trying almost all of the city?s famous street food in just two days. Egged on by Amrita, however, I steel my resolve, pack my bag and get on the bus to Indore.', 'In true Indori spirit, our breakfast begins withpohe-jalebi;we head to the curiously named Head Sahab Ke Usal Pohe in Old Palasia, opposite Greater Kailash Hospital. The stall got its name from the owner, who worked in the police department and was addressed as Head Sahab. The 40-year-old shop is now run by his son Pankaj and servespoheunlike any other in the city.Pohehere are topped withusal(a spicy curry of sprouts),chhole,paneerandsev. The spicy dish is balanced out with a generous topping of curd. Our next stop is Murliwala Sweets and Namkeen, near Bapat Chauraha, for thejalebis; straight off the wok, crisp and piping hot.', 'Sufficiently satiated till lunch, we drive to Rajwada, the historical palace built by the Holkars, the erstwhile maharajas of Indore. On the way, we pass by Sarafa Bazaar, the famous jewellery market in the city. ?You?ll see a completely different side of it at night,? says Amrita, as I try picturing it as a food street. Lunch is planned at Nafees in the Old Palasia neighbourhood, but before tucking into a bowl of fragranthaleem, we stop over at Goyal Juice in Palasia Market for a glass of coconut crush?a refreshing drink of coconutmalai(cream) and coconut water blended together with a little sugar and ice. It?s light and tastes like mild coconut milk. Our lunch is a warm bowl of comfort at Nafees; the restaurant makeshaleemonly on weekends. Their version of this slow-cooked dish of wheat, lentils, barley and meat is creamy, with slivers of mutton, and is topped withbirista(fried onion), coriander and chopped onions.', '', 'The night is reserved for Sarafa, so we try not to snack on anything for the rest of the day. But the evening is cold and a glass of hot, thick milk is mandatory. We head to Laxminarayan Doodh Wale Ki Puratan Dukan in Chhawani. The saffron-flavoured milk, which is boiled for hours and topped withmalai, is not just a drink in Indore, it?s an excuse to step out of the house and chat and socialize on nights when there is a nip in the air. At around 10pm, we head to Sarafa, which has a completely different appearance from what I had witnessed in the daytime. The jewellery shops are shuttered and the entire street is lined with makeshift food stalls. Our first stop is right at the entrance of the market, a small shop in the corner sellinghare chhod(green gram) andbatle(green peas)ki kachori. This flakykachoriis a winter speciality and has a filling of mashed green gram and peas. A little ahead, carts sell roasted green gram.', 'As we move into the street, the crowd starts getting thicker, and the shops are more densely packed. We stop at Suresh Chaat House towards the end of the street forbhutte ka keesandgaradu.Bhutte ka kees, a bright and yellow creamy paste, is made with grated corn that has been cooked in milk for hours. We?re served a plate topped with a spice mix, lime juice and generous garnish of fresh coriander and grated coconut. Another thing we try isgaradu(a variety of yam) which is chopped and deep-fried twice till its perfectly crisp and then tossed with a spice mix and lime juice. This snack can surely give any potato wedge worth its salt a run for its money.', 'A little ahead, at the end of the street, is Sanwariya?s cart sellingsabudana khichdi?a warm nourishing bowl, studded with peanuts and garnished with fresh coriander. Another speciality here is wafersbana ke?regular potato chips tossed withchaatmasala, lime juice and fresh coriander?yet another Indori innovation. Along the way, we samplegathiya chaat?besan gathiyatopped with onions, tomato, coriander and lime juice and, of course, the famouspani puri. The latter comes with 10 different kinds of flavoured water, our favourite being thekanji wada panimade with fermented mustard seeds. We end the night with the deliciousjalebas?giant-sizedjalebisandmawa bati, which is similar to thegulab jamun. One would think we had eaten enough for a month, by the time we wake up the next morning, we are again hungry.', 'Our Sunday begins on a healthy note at Jaivik Setu, an organic store on Bicholi Mardana Road. The store hosts a farmers? market and a pop-up breakfast every Sunday, serving wholesome food like multi-millet waffles, pesto wraps,thalipeethand a wonderfully aromatic lemongrass tea, all of which can be enjoyed sitting out in the open under the trees. This is also a great place to stock up on organic spices, raw sugar,dalia, and a variety of lentils.', 'Having saved our calorie intake in the morning, we indulged in a Sunday specialdal-batimeal at Hotel Rajhans. The no-frills restaurant serves one of the best Malwa-stylethalisin Indore, which includesghee-soakedbatiorbafla,dal, kadhi, potato curry and chutney.', 'My time in th city is almost up and there?s only one more meal to go. I am about to call it quits when my friend mentions Chappan Dukaan, the hub of Indore?s street-food culture. I decide to brave it and head there in the evening. The street, with 56 shops in the area, is teeming with people: There is an extraordinarily large crowd at Johny Hot Dog, famous for its legendary egg banjo?an omelette stuffed between a sweetish bun and served with a spicy green chutney. It?s a simple dish, but call it the magic of uncle Johny, who stands there flipping one omelette after another, or pure nostalgia, the locals seem to love it. At Vijay Chaat House, we stop forkhopra pattice?deep-fried potato fritters stuffed with a mix of coconut and chutney. After apaan petha(petharolled like apaanand stuffed with dry fruits) at Madhuram Sweets, we feel there?s scope for one last dish and the Maharaja Tea House Kachori Corner in Kothari Market provides the perfect ending to our Indore food trail with its wonderful sweet, spicy and crispbhutte ki kachori.']"

On a visit to the US last year, when I found out about an Italian food festival in Hoboken, New Jersey, I had to check it out for myself. Although I had tried a range of local cuisine during my stay in Italy, it was in the US that I had the zeppola for the very first time. These fluffy fried balls of dough, with a diameter of around 4 inches, are the Italian version of doughnuts.', 'At Hoboken, the zeppola stall was the only one with a really long line. After anxiously waiting for 30 minutes, we placed an order for two zeppole. The woman at the counter laughed and asked if I meant two dozen, because apparently that?s the measure in which it was being sold. After trying one from a set of 12, I was sold. I went back and queued up for another dozen.', 'This ?doughnut?, which originates in southern Italy, is usually topped with powdered sugar. It comes in different sizes and with a variety of fillings, such as custard, jelly, butter and honey, or ricotta with small pieces of chocolate, candied fruits and honey. There are savoury varieties of zeppole as well, filled with small fish such as anchovy, and commonly consumed in Calabria (south-west Italy) and the island nation of Malta. The savoury zeppole, apart from being shaped into balls, can also be stretched or twisted. The basic zeppola dough can be crisp, light and airy when made with puff pastry, or thicker and more bread-like when made with pizza dough.', 'There are Biblical references to this pastry. When Joseph fled to Egypt with Mary and baby Jesus, he began selling desserts, including the zeppole, to support his family. It was, however, in the early 19th century that zeppole were popularized by a baker named Pasquale Pintauro in Naples. Today, zeppole are widely available throughout southern Italy, including Rome, Naples, Sicily and Sardinia, as well as Malta and Croatia. Italian-American communities in Canada and the US also prepare this mouth-watering delicacy, especially during festivals such as the Festa di San Giuseppe (Saint Joseph?s Day) on 19 March, the Feast of San Gennaro, celebrated from 14-24 September, and around Christmas. In Calabria, people eat savoury zeppole on New Year?s Eve and New Year?s Day, and, in Malta, during Lent.', 'Zeppole are not all that common in Mumbai, but a chance discovery made me realize that I could easily make my own. While trawling through the internet for food delivery, I came across a recipe on the website of Foodhall, the gourmet food store. I have been eagerly looking forward to try my own version of the dessert since I found out that all the ingredients listed are easily available in my neighbourhood store. I was even more excited to learn that Francesco?s Pizzeria, a Mumbai-based eatery specializing in Italian cuisine, plans to add zeppole to its menu in the coming weeks. Davide Cananzi, Francesco?s consultant chef, has great memories of eating zeppole through a childhood spent in Sardinia. His version of the zeppole will be a simple fluffy pastry covered with a mix of sugar and cinnamon powder and topped with vanilla or chocolate custard.', 'A handful of Italian restaurants across the country serve this delicacy, including the Mumbai-based Gustoso, which makes a zeppole drizzled with Nutella, and Delhi Airport?s Radisson Blu Plaza, which offers the zeppole at its Italian-themed Sunday brunch.', 'Meanwhile, I am in the middle of perfecting my very own zeppole at home and introducing my friends and family to these delicious doughnuts without holes.']"

He had seen my Tinder profile and had ?super-liked? me. I learnt then that simply uninstalling the app didn?t eliminate your cyber-print. I instantly reloaded it on my phone, so I could erase my identity. I was afraid of being judged by anyone on the app who knew that I had not only been coupled for a decade but had even published a memoir about this grand love. What was he doing on the app, I asked, since I knew him to also be coupled. ?Just an experiment,? he said. ?My ex-girlfriend thinks I should see more women, she?s been swiping as well for me.?', 'I soon began questioning my shame at being ?found out? and my hypocrisy at even asking why he was on Tinder. Both were unwarranted because, despite being in a long-term relationship, in my weekly feminist column for a Mumbai-based tabloid, I actively define myself as single. At 32, I still live alone and don?t cohabit with my partner, nor am I clinging to him until ?the one? comes along. I am happily unmarried and am part of a growing tribe of women who derive intellectual, romantic, sexual and spiritual pleasure from multiple sources. I?m not referencing polyamory, I mean to say our lives are not centred on the premise of one big love, a soulmate that ?completes? us.', 'I suppose this epiphany was too recent to have been internalized. It was delivered to me by a series of friends, the first provocation coming from Mandakini Gahlot, 33, a journalist and film-maker who is the India correspondent for France 24, on the morning after my sister?s wedding. She was recounting a conversation she?d had with our mutual friend the day before, about how she was currently basking in the understated glory of what she referred to as small loves. I remembered how, when Mandakini?s last relationship was ending, and she was manifesting a conditioned anxiety about never being coupled again, I had told her that she was the kind of powerful and intriguing woman who would have multiple lovers across state borders. And I had meant it. I had envisioned this utopic future for her not to appease her, but because I couldn?t imagine one man capable of loving as much of her as there was to fall in love with.', 'Soul desires', 'After this conversation, I started thinking about the hierarchies we have been programmed to create, between small loves and big loves. We confine love either to sexual entanglements, unrequited romances, or marriage. We sacrifice, through underestimation, the string of other loves that have imprinted themselves like seals on our hearts. As women, especially, we are taught to treat female friendships as subservient alliances, not as primary relationships. Yet I could argue that Mandakini has been one of the greatest, most fulfilling loves of my life, a constant, while also being the subject of my next memoir. In my dedication, I refer to her as my soulmate. And she is by no means the only one.', 'Was this legitimate? To have many loves, multiple soulmates, to wilfully not subscribe to the heteronormative notion of ?the one?. ?Of course it is legitimate? why not?? clinical psychologist Amrita Narayanan began her response to my question. ?There are so many bases on which to celebrate relationships, and longevity is just one of them. If you ask around, you might find many married people acknowledging that their One Great Love was someone they didn?t marry, meaning that they are using another index?in this case, intensity of romance?to define the ?most glorious relationship?,? says Narayanan, who is also the author of the short story collection, A Pleasant Kind Of Heavy And Other Erotic Stories, and the more recent, The Parrots Of Desire, an anthology surveying 3,000 years of Indian erotica.', '', 'In her opinion, what long-term relationships offer that short-term ones cannot, is continuity, ?which often is helpful not only in and of itself, but in having a continuous sense of identity?. On the other hand, short experiences offer newness, she says. This is what Dossie Easton, the author of The Ethical Slut, calls New Relationship Energy (NRE) and vitality, an important counter to sameness. ?I think if someone is successful without a soulmate or long-term love, it means they have been able to find (or maybe they struggle to find) a sense of continuity, and for people who insist on a soulmate, maybe newness gets sacrificed or has to be searched for more actively. Perhaps friends could fill in the gaps in both cases,? she says on email.', 'Another writer who has validated my preference for the solitude of singlehood, coupled with the plenitude of abundant intimate relationships, is the Chennai-based Sharanya Manivannan, author of the short story collection The High Priestess Never Marries, and a more recent book of poetry, The Altar Of The Only World. ?So many of us are single, often not by choice, but so few of us think about singleness as anything other than an aberration. We?re conditioned to expect, want and shortchange ourselves because of the belief that one person will complete it,? she says. Manivannan, 32, defines herself as someone who is both consciously as well as circumstantially single, ?which is to say I chose to interrogate my particular scenario and understand the structural reasons (mostly to do with gender inequality) that render me un-partnered?. She confesses that she does sometimes feel the absence of a partner, because she enjoys the intoxication of caring for a person in a particular way. But she never loses sight of how that is only one particular way to care, to love, or to have companionship. ?One enormous learning on my journey was that my significant others are the people I love, full stop. Romance and sex, let alone the contract of matrimony, need have nothing to do with it,? she adds.', 'Mumbai-based journalist and writer Anushree Majumdar, 33, whose Facebook status updates are rife with charming tales of her Tinder exploits, also does not subscribe to the belief in one perfect, ultimate soulmate. She identifies as consciously single, because she isn?t entirely convinced she has what it takes to be in a long-term, monogamous relationship. ?The thing I find myself saying the most to any lover, whether it is a one-night stand or somebody for a little longer, is, ?let?s just be kind to each other?. Because it?s the kindness and intimacy of a regular boyfriend or partner that I miss the most?. Each person in my inner circle (and in my bed) fulfils a certain role and need and I?m sure I do the same in their lives.?', 'Singular plural', 'Why it had taken me so long to arrive at this revelation about the legitimacy of loving in plural is anyone?s guess. It?s because conversations about non-monogamous relationships are still not mainstream, and, when they are, are often steeped in shame and secrecy. ?This is something my single friends and I talk about with each other, because we?re helping each other navigate the single life,? says Majumdar ?We?re all ballsy and privileged enough to live the way we want, but judgement can bite us if and when it comes our way, which it mostly does from married folks.?', 'I, for one, am fortunate to count my married friend, an executive editor at a leading literary publishing company, among my many loves. A week ago, I returned to our Airbnb at midnight after the Jaipur Literature Festival?s closing dinner at Amer Fort all excited because she was up after her long evening siesta. When I went upstairs, she and I sipped on Solan Number One as we lay in bed nursing the munchies in our PJs, watching back-to-back episodes of Sex And The City. We had enlightening conversations about each other?s ?number?, a reference to an episode in which one of the show?s characters, Miranda, has to list all her sexual partners since she has just found out that she has contracted chlamydia. As I was falling asleep, it dawned on me how the iconic series had ended, with Big looking Carrie Bradshaw in the eye on the Seine and saying, ?Carrie, you?re the one.? Even though the last scene of the finale showed her reunited with her besties in New York, her happily-ever-after was premised on Big?s declaration.', 'Would there ever be any equivalent cinematic ending for single women? Or is it that by virtue of being un-partnered, we must make do with the myth of the cat lady (incidentally, a scenario that caused Miranda much anxiety)? Could it not be possible that we are, in fact, already living our blisses, content not to expend our energies in futile search operations for one person to complete our complexity?', 'Why settle for the one when you can love so many?', 'Rosalyn D?Mello is the author of the erotic non-fiction memoir,A Handbook For My Lover,out in paperback this month by HarperCollins India.']"

The PCRC is an initiative launched in practice last year by non-profit ACCESS Development Services, which works with women from marginalized backgrounds.', 'To Najma?s mind, the idea was outrageous. They wanted her, a woman well past 40, reclusive and unlettered, to not just step out into the world, but drive an electric autorickshaw on the tourist trail.', 'I heard Najma tell her story in December at a women at work conference in Jaipur, sitting sideways on stage, her face often hidden by herdupatta.

They are trying to see what to do in the off season, i.e. the summer months.', 'Radhika Kumari, who heads the organization, is enthusiastic as she talks about the PCRC, an offering she believes can be replicated in other cities.', 'The autorickshaws, one of which stood outside the conference hall, are like roomy ?convertibles? that allow the canopy to be folded away on pleasant days. They are noiseless, and don?t emit the smoke or fumes commonly associated with three-wheel vehicles. The rickshaws come with ergonomically designed seats, mechanical improvements for greater safety, a locker for keeping clients? belongings safe, a mobile charger, a water bottle/newspaper holder and city maps.', '', 'The look and specifications was the easy part, Kumari says. Getting the women to wear distinctive uniforms to stand out among other auto-drivers was not. Kumari chipped away at the resistance, taking her trainees to a mall, where they saw women guards in uniform, and realized uniforms could impart both authority and individuality.', 'It would usually take 10 hours at the wheel for an autorickshaw driver to make a profit. To make it a workable idea for women who had to run homes and would not be able to spare so much time, the PCRC came up with four tourist routes. Four hours on any of these routes would enable the women not only to meet their personal expenses, but make a profit too. ACCESS underwrites the expense on uniforms, battery replacement and other maintenance issues.', 'The more ambitious ones can do two such trips on some days, adding to their earnings considerably. The profits depend on each woman?s initiative. In addition, as most of their clients are high-end foreign tourists, they automatically get tips of up to 20%.', 'The women learnt quickly and progressed from using sign language to speaking a smattering of foreign language words, as Najma manages to do. The tourists do their bit too, using language guides, and, by the end of the trip, both driver and rider are happy.', 'Kumari is now planning to allow customized tour options, as well as an app, IVRS, or interactive voice response, to help clients call and communicate with them.', 'Not surprisingly, despite Jaipur being perceived as a tradition-bound city, support has been forthcoming from many agencies. Niche hotels and travel companies recruit the services of these autorickshaw drivers in pink uniforms as part of their offering of out-of-the-usual experiences to clients.', 'The company hopes to expand to 200 drivers soon even as many of the current 50 members are on their way to becoming empowered part-owners of the company.

Is it beyond time as we know it, is it sempiternal?not only everlasting but unchanging? Are we made better by knowing that love is fragile, a thing to be nurtured, protected, fed and watered? Or is it the idea of love as eternal, redemptive and salvific, that sustains us and allows us to live through unspeakable horrors, both individual and as a people?', 'The idea of love as the ultimate state of being is attractive?so much literature is about people, apparently just like us, who die for love. More accurately, we have a thousand stories about people who die before their love ends. Or changes. If we think of Romeo and Juliet, and Laila and Majnu, as being archetypal love stories, we need look no further than the subcontinent to find similar tales of tragic young love?Sohni and Mahiwal, Heer and Ranjha, from the folk tales of Punjab, and even Kannagi and Kovalan from the Tamil epicSilapathikaram. If film director Sanjay Leela Bhansali had had his untrammelled way, Padmavati andRatan Singh/Alauddin Khilji would have been included in this list as well.', 'For reasons of provenance (language and period of composition, mainly), the stories mentioned, and others like them, are considered legends or folk literature. Our classics, the epics in particular, have a rather different view of love. Stories of ecstatic, romantic, all-consuming love don?t appear in our myths. There are many stories of unrequited love or difficult love, but very few people die for it or of it. In fact, we have the opposite story to enjoy, one of living for love, as Savitri does when she wrests her beloved Satyavan from Death himself. Kunti lives to protect Pandu?s legacy even as Madri (whom he loved better) dies with him on his funeral pyre. Draupadi lives with the fact that the husband she loves most, Arjun, does not reciprocate the intensity of her feelings for him. Nal and Damayanti are separated by fate but eventually come together to live happily ever after. Shakuntala and Dushyant triumph in love after they overcome the vagaries of a decidedly peculiar curse, Parvati wins Shiv after years of difficult penance. And so on.', 'But the most complex and poignant story of a love that does not survive the choices and circumstances of its protagonists is the story of Ram and Sita. I use theValmiki Ramayanaas the basis for this understanding of the story, an understanding that considers the possibility that even the most idealized love can end. In theUttara Kanda, the last of the seven books that make up what we call theValmiki Ramayana, Sita calls upon the earth to swallow her when she is asked to prove her chastity again, this time in front of the people of Ayodhya. She asks that if she has been chaste, she be taken away. How did she get to this point, the point where the validation of her innocence against all the gossip and innuendo will lead to her exit from, rather than her continuing participation in, Ram?s life. In order to understand this, we need to reconsider the story as we know it.', 'Ram and Sita left for the forest as young people. We can surmise from other things in the story that they were probably in their early 20s, still flushed with youth. It was there that they really got to know each other, away from the hustle and bustle of duties and commitments in the opulent court of Ayodhya. They spent their happiest time with the sages and their wives, where Ram experienced a life of quietude and reflection. Already, in the days and nights since his father?s decree, Ram has questioned kshatriya dharma and doubted the values he has been taught to uphold. The sages have made him even more aware that there is another way to live in the world. After they leave the sages and settle deeper in the forest, in Chitrakut, Ram is the sweet and tender husband who brings flowers for Sita?s hair, who shares her joy and wonder at the forest animals that she feeds and looks after, who accompanies her when she goes down to the river to bathe. Sita discusses with Ram her concerns about the weapons he carries. She tells him that in the forest, violence must be renounced, and reminds him that he can go back to the manners and morals of the warrior that he was born to be when they return to Ayodhya. Ram listens and assures her he will use his weapons only against the oppressed. But, as Sita had predicted, it is violence that shatters their idyllic life. Shurpanakha is brutally mutilated, an act which results in a terrifying and vengeful retaliation against Sita. A cycle of blood-lust has been unleashed that will only be quenched with the killing of Ravan.', 'Once his wife has been stolen, Ram realizes that he has to become a kshatriya again if he is to win her back. Sita sustains herself during their separation with memories of her beloved from their time in the forest. When she meets Hanuman, apart from giving him her hair ornament as a token of recognition, she sends him back with a message for Ram. The message is a story of sweet intimacy, when she and Ram were alone together, a story that no one but the two of them could have known. These are the memories of love that make it possible for Sita to hold her head high when Ravan cajoles and threatens her. She can be strong because she knows she has not been abandoned.', '', 'Ram, on the other hand, appears to increasingly put away memories of Sita after his heart-rending sorrow when he finds her missing. He berates Lakshman for leaving her alone, he begs the trees and the animals to tell him where she has gone. But after this, he hardens his heart?it?s as if he knows that because she has been taken by another man, he will have to reject her when he gets her back. He will vanquish Ravan because that is what Kshatriya dharma demands, but that does not mean that he will be reunited with his wife, whom he loves more than anything else, in a happily-ever-after scenario.', 'After Sita has been taken, Ram expresses his anguish more and more in terms of the loss of his kingdom and the fact that he might lose his brave and loyal brother Lakshman. Sita is absent from his conversations, perhaps even from his mind. He kills Ravan to avenge his honour as the prince of Ayodhya, acting as a kshatriya should. While Sita has thought of nothing but her love, Ram has been busy putting together an alliance and planning a war.', 'The man that Sita meets after the war with therakshasas(demons) is not the man she knew and loved in the forest. She sees a battle-hardened warrior, a man who prefers to meet her in public rather than a husband who would wipe her tears of joy in private after such a long separation. This man tells her that he cannot take her back because she has lived in the house of another man. He has no use for her any more, she can go where she pleases. The war was fought not for her but for the honour of his family. Sita is horrified and asks Lakshman to build a fire?she will take a public trial to prove that she has been chaste. Of course, she is vindicated and, on the surface, there is a triumphal return to Ayodhya, with the happy ending of a restored kingdom and a restored marriage merely a breath away.', 'But that breath is never exhaled. When she is pregnant, Sita becomes the subject of town gossip about her time away from Ram. Ram, now king, chooses to bow to the dictates of his public position?he asks Lakshman to take Sita away, back to the forest where they had spent their happiest times together. At this point, Sita realizes that she will never be Ram?s beloved again, she will always be his wife, his queen, his consort.', 'Fourteen years later, when Ram hears the story of his own life from his sons, he summons Sita?she must prove her innocence once more, in front of his people, so that he can be with her again. This is when Sita decides that her innocence should be the reason for her departure. Ram has become a man she does not know, cannot love; her love for him has ended. Ram has become king and Sita has lost the tender lover of the days in the forest, the man she pined for in her captivity, the man she waited to embrace after their months of separation. She decides that she cannot, will not, live with a lesser love, a love that was compromised when it was sacrificed on the altar of public duty.', 'Sita?s love could not survive all that happened to her?her abduction, her captivity, the suspicions about her and her banishment. When she finally asserts herself, it is to take control of her destiny and leave Ram forever. Ram is distraught?his love has remained steadfast through all that he made his wife endure. After Sita has left, Ram creates a golden statue of his beloved wife. The statue is not only a substitute for the queen at all the royal rituals and ceremonies, it is a reminder to Ram himself of everything that he has lost as a king. For me, this is where the tragedy of the Ramayan lies?in the understanding that love can die, despite our best intentions, despite our efforts to keep it alive. For all that Ram is devastated when Sita leaves him, it?s hard to imagine that Sita did this with any sense of joy or liberation. Her heart, too, must have been heavy. For surely, the burden of a love that has ended is far greater than that of a love that has been lost. Perhaps it is only in our maturity that we see this as a possibility. And we smile through our tears for the young who are eternally in love.', 'Arshia Sattar has been working with theValmiki Ramayanafor 30 years. Her most recent book isUttara: The Book Of Answers.']"

It has a small rock-climbing centre, the General Thimayya National Academy of Adventure, set up by the state government. While climbing workshops for men from rural areas are organized every year, little or no effort is made to develop the region or nurture its climbers in the long term.', '', 'In 2015, Praveen formed a climbing team, SportClimbing India, with five teenagers from Badami?s rural areas. He donated his personal equipment to the team, and tries to upgrade it with his own money. He doesn?t charge the students. ?Most of my gear was won in competitions. When I was younger, I couldn?t afford to buy them either. I would work hard to win competitions, so I could also win the gear. Now it?s come full cycle. Whatever this sport gave me, I?m giving back to the sport,? says Praveen.', 'Last year, a climber from Chile sponsored some equipment, and Prana, a US-based clothing company, donated some clothes.

Rarer still are people or organizations that support and fund climbers. When I met Praveen three years ago, he seemed somewhat jaded by competitions. But he was excited at the idea of setting up India?s first rural climbing team. He believes Badami has the potential to turn into a world-class climbing destination.', 'Chitradurga was his next area of focus. Although this historical town has a lot of granite boulders, there were no bolted sport routes his students or otherclimbers could use.

When you love, how does it feel? When you desire, why is it different? What are you most drawn to in your partner and why?The Belgian psychotherapist and best-selling author interlinks the questions into a sticky web that seems so real that I imagine her live audience must want to scream its way out of it with a loud chorus: ?Tell us!?', 'Perel?s primary argument is that the spread of a new brand of romanticism is spelling a crisis of desire. In her 2017 bookThe State Of Affairs: Rethinking Infidelity, she unpacks these ideas further, questioning the new romantic ideal in which we turn to one person to fulfil an endless list of needs?effectively diluting the share of sex and desire in the mix. ?Marriage used to be for economic and social status?we still want that, plus we expect our partners to be our greatest lover, best friend, trusted confidant, best co-parent, emotional companion, intellectual equal?and we live twice as long,? she says. ?We want from one person what once an entire village used to provide.?', 'When Siddharth Mangharam, co-founder of the singles community Floh, told me about their new launch, Floh For All, it immediately resonated with Perel?s hypothesis. I asked if he had listened to Perel?s TED talk, and Mangharam said it was her debunking of this ?Superhero Partner? that Floh For All seeks to address. Just out of its testing phase, it is a platform comprising different communities of people looking to meet others in the same life-stage: new-to-the-city professionals, empty nesters, expectant mothers, patients (and their caregivers) with rare diseases like haemophilia and so on.', 'Loungewas one of the first publications to report on Floh, in February 2012, less than a year after it had launched. In the cover story, Mangharam, a management graduate whose first start-up, Peek, was into cloud computing, had said Floh was positioning itself as a clutter-breaker in a market crowded with wedding-oriented websites. Cool, urban India wanted to find love, and while marriage could be a long-term goal, they did not want it to colour all their relationships.', 'The business strategy came from Mangharam?s own real-life meet-cute: He had met his wife Simran (co-founder of Floh) at a party in Bengaluru over a platter of Roquefort. The idea was to go one step ahead of dating apps and websites and facilitate meetings for singles over strategically-curated group events. His lofty mission then was the ?business of catalysing serendipity?.', '', 'Seven years later, ?love? only has a supporting role to play in his business plan. What prompted the evolution of a singles dating platform into a community network? The answer, as the 2018 FlohSingle In The Citysurvey results corroborate, is that people prize everyday companionship slightly higher than romance, with emotional support a close third, when asked about the top 3 things they want from a relationship. The bottom-line is that it?s not all moons and bedrooms.', '?Our biggest insight after running Floh all these years is that people, regardless of their relationship status, are desperately seeking human companionship,? says Mangharam. There were two inflection points. Around three years ago, Floh did away with the idea of playing matchmaker. It started focusing on ?people having a good time and being themselves?. A few months ago, the idea of building a community that privileges companionship based on personal needs came up. ?Specifically, to include those looking to connect with like-minded people in the real world, but not in a romantic context,? he says. Mangharam shares instances of couples who met at Floh (or elsewhere), but have been regularly attending Floh For All events. Activities range from sushi-rolling workshops to single-malt tastings and, free from the trappings of heteronormative couplings, are open to people who identify as queer, polyamorous or asexual?as opposed to restrictive dating apps . So, while earlier it appeared distasteful if a dating network aimed at the upwardly mobile put marriage upfront, it is now undesirable for them to have even love and sex upfront. ?Floh now defines itself as a singles network and not a singles dating platform, while Floh For All is ?family and fun oriented?. It?s about putting yourself first,? says Mangharam.', '', 'Love thyself', 'Is the crisis of love today that we love ourselves a bit too much? Are we sacrificing romance at the altar of self-love? As many as 66.6% of the respondents said they were dating less now than they were a few years ago, with little variation between male and female respondents.', '?I find this response very interesting?despite the surge in dating apps, both men and women are dating a lot less than they were earlier. We are seeing this as a trend in the West too and the reasons are broadly linked to screen addiction and social media. Ultimately, a sharpening of this pattern leads to social isolation and depression. In the US, where there?s a lot of data on this topic, the number of youth dying of suicide has increased significantly.... This could be an even bigger issue in India, where our awareness  around mental health is woefully inadequate,? says Mangharam, adding, ?In a lot of ways, we intuitively felt this and thus launched Floh For All to help a broader set of people. It?s great to see strong data to back our hypothesis, though, personally, I?m concerned, and believe that we?re heading towards a loneliness epidemic.?', 'Additionally, there is a mismatch between ground realities and expectations of what is ?normal??an overwhelming majority of respondents, 62.6%, believe sex ?multiple times a week? is the prerequisite for a fulfilling relationship. But few count themselves in that number.', 'Too ready to mingle', 'For those in relationships, the crisis of love takes a different beat. One of the things that Perel explores inThe State Of Affairs: Rethinking Infidelity, and a second TED talk by the same name, is how infidelity, which earlier threatened our physical security, now threatens our emotional security. It comes back to the idea of the ?Superhero Partner?. One?s self-worth is so tied to a single partner that a partner?s infidelity threatens our very self-identity.', '?It?s never been easier to cheat and it?s never been more difficult to keep a secret and never has infidelity exacted such a psychological toll on us. Infidelity hurts differently today. It is the ultimate betrayal. It shatters the grand ambition of love,? says Perel in her talk.', 'It doesn?t help that the definition of infidelity and cheating is mutating so rapidly?sexting, pornography, staying active on dating apps well into a relationship ?that Perel estimates the figures for infidelity in committed or married couples around the world vary from 26-75%.', 'This  blurring of boundaries might explain why survey respondents said they found it harder to reconcile if their partner engaged in an emotional affair rather than a physical affair.', 'As Perel says, we would, earlier, divorce to be happy. Today we divorce because we could be happier. Choosing to stay when you can leave is the new shame as we live in an era where we believe I, not we, deserve to be happy.', 'One must pay attention when even people who used to be in the ?business of love? have shifted focus. ?At Floh, we emphasize on an individual?s need to be known, self-expression, and a positive self-identity,? says Mangharam.

True to form, Riyas Komu, whose practice has been embedded in the vocabulary of state signs and symbols, uses a range of media in his recent solo exhibition to visually discuss what he terms the presently rising ?militant enthusiasm?. Edited excerpts from an interview with the artist:', 'How did you arrive at the show?s title, ?Holy Shiver??', 'My works for the exhibition are not based on the concepts of Austrian zoologist and ethologist Konrad Lorenz?sOn Aggression, but the title came as a natural progression of my critical engagement with the themes explored. I didn?t start my work thinking ofHoly Shiverbut I came across this accidentally during the final stages of conceptualizing the exhibition and the term and concept seemed appropriate, referencing ?the behavioural tendency of willing to kill or be killed in defence of one?s own community?. Lorenz talks about how this tendency physically manifests in the tingling sensation in the spine?a pre-human reflex for the raising of hair on the back of an animal as a preparatory step for a fight when confronted with an enemy.', 'What was your artistic methodology?', 'The works that formHoly Shiverare an extension of my practice. I have been working with the image (and ideas) of (Mahatma) Gandhi and (B.R.) Ambedkar for some time now. However, I am interested in exploring these not only as figments of history or as a reminder of an ?ideal that we had?, but in their moral and conceptual frameworks, in their aesthetics and philosophies. The Gandhi/Ambedkar juxtaposition also considers the current debates, negotiations and reconciliation arguments that are prevalent in the Indian socio-political space. For me, it?s interesting to witness how our ideas of ?identity?, ?freedom? and ?sovereignty? are shifting to accommodate the onslaught of globalization and nationalism. So these works?oil portraits, woodcuts, installations and archival prints, framed in a space, time and context?are self-explanatory. I see them as an archive of our times, however incomplete it may be.', 'You transfer the image and make a woodcut out of it. On the other hand, the content of these images is deeply disturbing footage, evidence of our inhumanity.

Are you looking to recontextualize images from an existing archive?', 'TitledHoly Shiver(2018), the woodcut series are limited-edition prints that explore some of the acts of violence in social spaces throughout the history of independent India. It explores the misuse of power by the people; to self-organize, to take the law into their own hands, to disregard constitutionally granted freedoms, and to use caste-based oppression to bolster state-sanctioned authority.', '', 'It is a continuation of theStoned Goddesses(2013) series that also explored violence and the displacement of different times. I have been influenced by the stark, simplistic style of the German artist Käthe Kollwitz, who was fearless in critiquing the social systems of her time. She wanted her art to make an impact and be reflective of the times she lived and worked in. My woodcut series is representative of the images of public violence already in wide circulation. They create a tragic resonance between these dark chapters in Indian history. I have admired Pablo?s work and have collected some of his photographs of the 1984 riots. The image that I have used is from his archive, which I have also referred to in myStoned Goddessesseries. Pablo was very happy to share his image to be used for this series. I don?t mean to recontextualize these tragedies and give them new meaning or to add to what already has been said, but I mostly recontextualize images in my works as a form of remembrance. And this extends beyond my woodcut series.', 'Would you consider your show a provocation to remind audiences about their role as citizens?', 'The founding principles declared in the Constitution of India assert its citizens? right to justice, equality and liberty and establish the country as a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic.

The factors on which the working of those organs of the state depend are the people and the political parties they will set up as their instruments to carry out their wishes and their politics.? Our willingness to turn a blind eye to the state and social apparatuses that aim to subvert these freedoms (for a certain section of the populace) have now resulted in disillusionment with the way the system works. Of course, I understand that there is a fundamental disagreement on the idea of India, but this conflict of vision is precisely because the Constitution has afforded us certain freedoms, and not in spite of it.', 'What is your fascination with public memory?', 'I have always been fascinated with what we remember. Public memory is notoriously short-lived. And I think it?s a challenge to situate public memory at a time when we are oversaturated with images and when certain sections of the society are happy with the hyper-partisan news, information and images that simply conform to what they already know and believe in. So in a way, the public?s memory is the curse of the public. This is perhaps why it?s easier to erase certain symbols from history than to reinstate their intent. So yes, in a way there is the need to question public?s memory or the ways in which we (the people) remember certain histories. That?s why many works inHoly Shiveremploy (or challenges the viewer to rely on) public memory to unravel momentous melancholies in time.

Photographer Pablo Bartholomew, along with the academy?s students of visual and fine arts, has been designing an exhibition inspired by the DNA sequences of Chakma weavers.', 'Long horizontal lines, drawn out withjhaadu ki teeli(reeds used in brooms), are interspersed with 24 photographs taken by Bartholomew of this indigenous hill tribe in Bangladesh and North-East India. Through this new body of work,Untitled, created especially for the nine-day Dhaka Art Summit (DAS, 2-10 February), he takes a closer look at this community, spread across geographies. He also investigates how its cultural DNA?embodied in weaves, oral traditions, body markings and adornments?becomes a mark of self-identity, thus creating an indelible bond that keeps the community together in the midst of constant displacement and migration.', '', 'The work fits in with the overarching theme of DAS? fourth edition, Bearing Points, which replaces the Solo Projects section of the summit with large-scale thematic presentations by artists and architects. One of the Bearing Points, There Was Once A Village Here, is a cross-border inquiry into cultures inhabiting ?sensitive spaces?, ones that challenge ideas of nations, states and territories. Bartholomew talks about the direction that this ?work-in-progress? is likely to take in the future. Edited excerpts from a phone interview:', 'A lot of your recent work, ?Nagas: Hidden Hill People Of India? and ?Affinities?, draws on personal associations and memories. How does the current work take this thread forward?', 'I have a family link of sorts with the Chakma community, from my mother?s side. The project, which has been commissioned and backed by the Samdani Art Foundation (the organizer of DAS), is about fractured geographies and the communities that inhabit these. They live across borders in Bangladesh, Burma (Myanmar) and India. So far, I have been able to interact with the Chakma community in Bangladesh and India, and hope to visit Burma in the future. In some ways, the genesis of this work goes back to the visual anthropological project with the Naga tribes. That too had a personal story to it. While growing up, I had heard stories from my father of the kindness that the tribes had shown him, as he walked from Burma to India to escape persecution from the invading Japanese forces. Over a period of 10 years, starting 1989, I photographed the tribes, documenting the Naga fusion of tradition and modernity. While Nagas were the main group I photographed, I also took photos of ethnic groups in Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur as well. That?s when I came across cultural markers, across indigenous communities, as forms of self-identity. It is triggers such as these that shape and inspire my practice.', '', 'You have extended the scope of your practice by incorporating weaves?', 'The current body of work is just an experiment. The weaving is sort of a test to see if the Chakma artisans can depart from their traditional weaves to interpret DNA markers. Eventually, what will happen is that diagrams of the DNA, mapped by scientific research institutions, will be sent back to the tribes, to be woven. It will be a metaphoric way of saying how the tradition of craft is carried forth generationally through the DNA. Through these woven patterns, they will then look at their own shared genetic make-up that goes beyond modern-day boundaries and geopolitical borders.', 'How have the weavers responded to your idea?', 'I am working with a national award-winning master weaver and some village women, who have taken up the challenge. That?s the interesting part?how different weavers are approaching the concept to produce very different results.', 'You are bringing together science, legend, tradition and art. Could you talk about your collaborations with the scientists?', 'I have been in dialogue with several research institutes such as The Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad, and the Genome Foundation, Hyderabad. I will try and work with Dr Niraj Rai, who is an ancient DNA specialist. The mentor for the scientific aspect of the project was Dr Lalji Singh (also known as the father of Indian DNA fingerprinting), who passed away recently. It is because of such instances that the project has taken several twists and turns. Right now, what you see before you is proof of concept. I hope to realize it fully by the next Dhaka Art Summit in 2020.', 'We have seen fabulous images of the work being put together on Instagram. Could you talk about this unique exhibition design?', 'When I arrived in Dhaka, some weeks ago, I didn?t know what I would use as my base medium. After discussions with a fantastic team of volunteers of art and photography students, we zeroed in on thejhaadu ki teeli, that is used with water to sweep, as the base. One thing that I was very clear about was that I wanted to base the exhibition design on the DNA patterns. The lines and columns on the wall are suggestive of the wells of the gel, into which the broken-up DNA is injected, which then settles at different points. The framed photos have been placed at those points. The photos showcase the everyday objects and landscapes of the Chakma people. The work has been divided into three parts?with images of the Chakmas from Tripura on the left, those from the Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bangladesh, on the right. At the very centre are images of four textiles by weavers from either side of the border, who have interpreted the DNA in their patterns.']"

While learning how to make biryani, I understood why it is one of the finest dishes in the Indian repertoire.

Aratrik Dev Varman, a designer from Tripura who is based in Ahmedabad, presented his label Tilla, translating the traditional Tripuri breast cloth into contemporary resort wear. Dev Varman works withriahs?fabrics that range in width from 9-16 inches and are woven on backstrap looms. ?The breast cloth is an ancient sartorial tradition of Tripura. There could have been so many ways of reusing those, piecing several together, cutting them up, but I wanted to retain their authenticity. They are precious and are woven narrow. I wanted to work along that basic trait, instead of doing something radically different. This is Lakmé Fashion Week?s resort show, and you?ve got a resort look, with a breast cloth made in Tripura,? said Varman in an interview after the show.', 'The region-specific focus at the LFW?s Sustainable Fashion Day, with a designer each from Meghalaya, Sikkim, Nagaland, Manipur, Tripura and Assam made for perfect timing, given the focus on handlooms, sustainability and minimalism.', 'Daniel Syiem from Meghalaya showed an androgynous line called ShaKiLum, made of an Ahimsa silk fabric called Ryndia.

He has previously shown at the Couture Fashion Week in New York (2014) and London Fashion Week (2014), among other international showcases.

Jaspreet Chandok, vice-president and head (fashion), IMG Reliance, said in a welcome note. IMG is roping in a host of partners?Fashion Revolution, a UK-based advocacy group, and the British Council?with the UN, which is part of this collaborative effort. Yuri Afanasiev, resident coordinator of the UN in India, toldLoungein a phone interview that ?we are no authority on fashion but we have a strong grass-roots base in the North-East region?.', 'The collaboration, ?still at an embryonic stage?, aims to study the sector and provide a strategy to develop the region?s fashion supply chain. Afanasiev points out the changing ways that support needs to be provided in growing economies. ?Providing craftspeople stalls in the local market is not the answer any more. The answer today is really about integrating into modern supply chains. How do we fill the gap between beautiful craftsmanship, colours and patterns, and what the market demands? What do local producers need to be able to bridge that gap? How can designers and corporations help with issues like quality and quantity? Complying with export rules and regulations?that kind of advice is not available to the average Indian farmer, weaver or textile business owner. That?s where this partnership makes sense,? he says. The UN is particularly focused on women?s developement, ?because the labour participation of women in India is remarkably low at 27%, and actually has a declining trend which is not characteristic of big, vibrant economies that are growing at 7-8% a year.?', 'At the same time, there are concerns about over-commercialization.  ?It?s an area of very fragile eco-systems. There are traditional crafts that can be sustainably developed instead of introducing some modern industry,? says Afanasiev.', 'From a designer?s perspective, Dev Varman stresses the need to have ?a light footprint? when working in the North-East. ?There?s a responsibility in being a catalyst. You can go in and not be aware of the long-term consequences of your actions, because it can be very heady to create something new. Craft traditions are a way of life for certain people. These are fine minds, not just skilled labour. So, as designers, we must be sensitive to that,? says Dev Varman.', 'When footballer Bhaichung Bhutia walked the ramp for Karma Sonam?a designer from Sikkim who presented her label, Kuzu?the cheers wouldn?t stop. At a post-show press conference, a shy, smiling Bhutia said: ?People from the North-Eastern states have always been very stylish.? The show was enough evidence of that.']"
