Analysts polled by ET Now poll expected PAT or net profit to come in at Rs 174 crore.Revenues grew 17.7 per cent YoY to Rs 1,840 crore, aided by robust performance in US formulations on the back of price and volume increase in some products, market share gain in divalproex sodium ER and favorable currency movement.After rallying a little over 18 per cent so far in the year 2014, analysts see further upside in the stock supported by attractive valuations. The stock plunged a little over 10 per cent in the calendar year 2013 as compared to nearly 9 per cent rally seen on the Sensex.The share price of Cadila Healthcare had been trading in a range of Rs 925 to Rs 660 since May 2011. It is important to note that the stock price has now started to trade above the rectangular price channel, says Mitesh Thacker of miteshthacker.com.Thacker is of the view that traders should therefore look to accumulate the stock in range of Rs 950-925 and keep a stop placed below levels of Rs 885. They can look for a price target of Rs 1150 in the coming months, which represents over 20 per cent upside from Wednesday\'s closing price of Rs 948.55.Long-term momentum indicators on the monthly charts are in a rising mode.Given the overall technical picture there is a strong possibility of a price breakout occurring at the end of February 2014.Dolat Capital is of the view that FY14 will be a year of recovery for Cadila Healthcare.""We estimate a strong 28 per cent EPS CAGR for FY14 -16E with RoCE and RoE in the range of 19-20% and 24-26% in FY15E/16E, respectively,"" it says.The brokerage firm remains positive on the long-term prospects of the company. They maintain \'accumulate\' rating on the stock with a revised target price of Rs 1,067.SBICap Securities upgraded the stock to \'buy\' and raised its target price to Rs 1,062 based on pickup in US approval cycle, domestic growth revival and reasonable valuation (trading at 14x F16e).""We expect next two years earning CAGR of 27 per cent (from 7% in F10-13). We are raising our EPS estimates by 1-2% for F15-16e on better margin prospects,"" the brokerage firm said in a note.With improving earnings visibility, step-up in the capital returns ratios (29 per cent in RoE and 17 per cent RoCE by F16e) and trailing underperformance (21% versus sector index), SBICap Securities believes that the stock can get re-rated to three-year historic P/E multiple of 21x on one-year forward.']"

In India the company sells nearly nine biosimilar drugs.In India, too, generic drugs makers have been sporadic in their biosimilar launches.

Was that the case now or was the entire facility inspected this time?The entire facility was inspected.Now you have 200 pending ANDA approvals, how many of these are filed fromMoraya?About 60 are from Moraya facility which are pending for approval and many of them we should see the approval coming in.What has been the amount spent on the remediation of the Moraya plant till now?I cannot give you a specific number but we invested over a period of last two years in terms of improving the overall automation in the plant and also doing significant work in the culture building for quality in the whole facility. I cannot give you the specific investment number but we have invested significantly to make the plant fully compliant and the result is that now that FDA was satisfied with our plant inspection.In the conference call you said that the Cadila management expects at least 15-20 approvals every year ex Moraya, now how will this change post this clearance?We should expect significant approval coming in, in FY18 we expect 40 plus approvals may be happening now.Cadila has further gained market share in theAsacol HDto 60% what is the way ahead for this drug and would you have the option to launch your own version too?I think Asacol, we have currently launched a generic, authorised generic and we currently intend to continue with authorised generic.If you see the Q3 numbers, the EBITDA margin has fallen to a three-year low because of the high pricing pressure and the lack of new launches as well, do you think this clearance will now change this trend for you in the next quarter to come?Definitely once we see the product approval happening, including some of the very important products, we will definitely see the margin improvement happening.""]"

Edited Excerpts.Are you liking anything from the FMCG or consumer space currently given that there is more clarity on the GST front?Largely we expect GST to beearningsneutral for FMCG and Consumer sector in the near-term since any benefits from reduction in taxes & duties will have to be passed on to the end consumers. At the same time we also expect GST to be positive for organised segment in the medium to long-term as it increases itsmarket sharegiven better pricing and quality of product. Currently, given the ambiguity over tax rate onproductwise basis more clarity is required to understand the final impact onstocksand sectors. It is possible that certain products within the consumer durables may fall into higher tax slab impacting profitability. In the near-term there also persists ariskof de-stocking in the industry ahead of the implementation of GST. Broadly if the impact on taxation is neutral and sea change of improvement will be on transportation, logistic warehousing and inventory turnover. This benefit will be visible on the cashflow andbalance sheetover the time as GST becomes efficiently workable. Two stocks we are positive based on GST areHavellsand BataIndia.Will PSU banks continue to rally or would you rather look at private banks?Marketsreacted with some positivity to FM's plan for a solution to theNPAproblem.Recent rally in PSU banks has been driven by optimism over the likely set of measures to be announced by the government on new NPA resolution framework and recapitalisation. Indian banks are exposed to approximately Rs 6 lakh crore NPA, of which 5.5lakh crore are within PSU banks. Uncertainly on recapitalisation and NPA woes have been haunting valuations of PSU banks.Marketis keeping high expectations on the government with final steps to provide more leeway and power to banks. The steep discount in valuation to private peers is supporting the current rally in expectations of quicker resolution of NPA woes. The new framework is expected to provide a sustainable solution to the NPA mess in the system and revolve around measures to quicken recovery and resolution. The sustainability of this rally would depend on the efficacy of the measures and efficient usage by PSUBs to resolve the current NPA mess. Recapitalisation could strengthen the balance sheet of PSUBs, but muted loan growth and inefficiencies remains a concern. We are constructively positive on PSUBs in the medium term while continue to remain bullish on private banks which have healthy balance sheet and robust outlook. Currently PSUB index is valued fairly about 1x P/B on a one year forwards basis which is about 10%premiumto its last 3 yr average.Is it a good time to take a short-term view on IT companies given their low valuations? Anything you like hereIT industry is going through a phase of consolidation owing to transformation to digital and issues related to HI-B visa & US policy. We remain cautious in the short term due tosharprupee appreciation and further lowering of FY18 earnings guidance due to limited discretionary spending by large clients. But industry is adapting to new transformation at war footing, and we therefore believe the sector will be back on growth engine. Currently the sector is trading at a P/E of 14x FY18 EPS which is 14% discount to its 5yr historical average of (16x). This provides room for long-term investors to add in the sector as the sector will consolidate in the near-term due to headwinds mentioned above. The earnings trajectory is likely to stabilize over FY19 which will create optimism for upside in valuation.What are you bullish on in the pharma space given that things are looking up for the sector?US government?s intention to bring down drug prices and price control measures is providing a muted outlook for the sector given high exposure in US market. At the same time USFDA issues are impacting the respective stocks according to the extent of the nature. As a culmination of both these factors, pharma sector is underperforming. When we look forward, pharma companies are anticipating increased approval momentum in the US from FY18 onwards, this could provide an interim support while USFDA issue moderates in the future. We recommend companies with strong domestic base, clean chit from the USFDA and strong presence in niche markets (low competition). Currently we suggestCadila HealthcareandLupinfor investment.What are some stocks on your radar lately?Two stocks which comes in the picture are BEL and Asian Paint.Bharat Electronics Ltd(BEL): Is the majorbeneficiaryof GoI?s renewed focus on defence throughmake in Indiaand higher indigenous procurement. BELhas market leadership in defence electronics given its strong execution capabilities and technological tie-ups. Long term earnings visibility has significantly improved due to healthy order book and better than expected traction in execution. Order intake is expected to grow at healthy rate supported by large-ticket orders from the vast opportunities tied up with the current defence modernization programme.Asian Paints Ltd(APNT): Increase in disposable income, urbanization and reduced interest cost will scale up the consumers? aspiration for betterlifestyle, which will drive the growth of the paints sector. Given the competitive presence and strong brand recall, APNT will be the large beneficiary as the Indian paint sector penetrate from traditional emulsions to decorative paints. Recently APNT has announced 3% hike in price while stability in crude price will support margins.""]"

Indian formulation sales (contributing 29% to sales) fell ~19% YoY impacted by destocking of inventory ahead of GST implementation. Despite pricing pressure, US sales rose by robust 14% YoY supported by inorganic growth (Sentynl acquisition) and key drug launches. EBITDA margin came in at 12.6% (down 1030 bps YoY), mainly due to lower sales and rise in the employee and R&D expenses.

The AG launch may not mean so much for market share loss, but will definitely put downward pressure on pricing. Therefore, the product may not remain as attractive for Cadila as it would have been in a two-player market. Due to this we expect Lialda revenue to dampen by ~Rs.65cr to ~Rs.98cr over FY17-19E. The company expects ~30 ANDA approvals from Moraiya and ~10 from other facilities, which will boost US sales. Trademark acquisitions from Astrazeneca for products in gynaecology, anaesthesia and anti-infectives are expected to drive Indian formulation business.

However, while the likes of Lupin and Sun Pharma gave returns in the range of 48-54 per cent,Cadila Healthcaredisappointed. The stock of the company, which has strong presence both in the US and Indian markets, was down 10.39 per cent over the last year. Its fortunes, according to analysts, are likely to change in the coming financial year, given its strong product portfolio in the US market as well as a pick-up in domestic sales.In anticipation of better performance and an upgrade by Bank of America Merill Lynch, the stock surged over five per cent to Rs 845 in trade on Wednesday. The research firm, which has upgraded the stock from ?underperformer? to ?buy,? increased its price target from Rs 705 to Rs 1,000. Manoj Garg and Matthew Prior of the research firm say while there is little upside on the earnings front in the current financial year, earnings accelaration inFY15is likely to happen on the back of a pick up in US approvals, recovery in domestic growth and base effect of the Hospira joint venture. While the research firm has cut its FY14 earnings estimates by six per cent, they have raised the same for the next two fiscals by three to seven per cent.?While growth concern in FY14 (six per cent fall) led to stock underperformance, we believe improvement in growth visibility (30 per cent earnings per share compounded annual growth rate estimated over FY14-16) and improvement in return ratios will drive re-rating of the stock and valuations can go back to historical level (19-20x). Further, we believe that with increased assets utilisation and improvement in margins, return rations and balance sheet ratios are set to improve,? they add.On the US sales front, analysts believe that the company has done well considering the issues at its Moraiya facility. Credit Suisse in a December report on the company said though it was a late entrant in the US market, it has shown good execution so far with an average portfolio (70 per cent of Cadila's products having more than six generic competitors and portfolio market share is at 20 per cent).?It is good execution considering that last year was a washout for Cadila, due to a warning letter at Moraiya facility that prevented any new approvals,? according to Anubhav Aggarwal and Chunky Shah of the research firm.The company has a strong US product pipeline, with 33 filed in FY13 and over 35 expected to be filed in FY14, resulting in a large portfolio of 191 filings in all till the September quarter.However, the delays in approvals has severely impacted the company?s topline and bottomline."", 'After growing at 44 per cent between FY09-12, the company is expected to grow at just 10 per cent over the FY12-14 period.With resolution of theUSFDAissues (plant cleared in July 2012) and the company now expecting higher number of approvals, expect growth rates to pick up. The US opportunity is expected to be strong given the company is likely to get key approvals such as Toprol XL (four-five players in a $400-500 million market) among others. While the company has robust pipeline and new filings are in more profitable niche and limited competition products, successful execution is a key for future growth, believe the BofA-Merrill Lynch analysts.The company is expected to do well on the domestic front as well. For the December quarter, HDFC Securities analyst Meeta Shetty believes growth here will be led by Cadila, due to a favourable season. The performance is notable, given the rift between chemists and distributors on the one hand and companies on the other. The analyst expects the company?s domestic sales to grow 13 per cent in the quarter as compared to four per cent in the September quarter.On the impact of the new pricing policy, while this is likely to hamper revenues in the short term, the company is expected to recoup some losses by increasing volumes on drugs which fall under the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) and price increases in those that are out of that ambit. For October and November, the company recorded domestic sales growth of 5.5 per cent, with most of the improvement from drugs which are not under NLEM. Sales of drugs under the NLEM were down 12 per cent for the two months as compared to the same period last year. Non-NLEM medicines grew 10 per cent over that period.']"

Strides Arcolab had a similar letter, termed a ?Form 483? (when, in an FDA investigator?s judgment, the observed conditions or practices indicate an FDA-regulated product might be in breach of its requirements), issued in August 2014 and the company resolved it with no escalations. Cadila had got a Form 483 from the FDA in September 2014 and the Street had become nervous on the action that could be taken against the company.Analysts, however, remain upbeat, as the company continues doing well in the US. According to IMS data, the company?s trailing three-month sales in the month of January showed the highest growth (eight per cent) among Indian peers. This trend continued in February.', ""Antique Broking?s US generic pharma monitor says Dr Reddy?s and Cadila continued to gain better share in their key products in February, too, as compared to others.Notably, the company continues to gain share in its other key products of Wellbutrin XL (anti-depressant), Urocit-K (urinary treatment) and Niaspan (lipid control), beside huge growth in the anti-malarialgenericsof Plaquenil (a $440 million per annum drug) that had also driven Cadila?s performance in the December ?14 quarter.According to a note by analysts at Nomura on IMS data for the week ending March 13, Plaquenil saw its market share increase to 38.7 per cent (up 800 basis points), from around 30 per cent in end-December. The gains were helped by a decline in Ranbaxy?s market share in the product from about 65 per cent at end-September to about 33 per cent now, and after IPCA had voluntarily suspended shipments of the formulation to the US after alerts on its Ratlam unit.Genericsof Urocit-k, a limited competition ($120 million) drug), saw Cadila?s market share increase from 20.3 per cent in December to 29.2 per cent for the week ending March 13. The price rise by the company and limited competition in anti-malarials is likely to drive margin growth, too.In this backdrop, analysts expect Cadila to post strong growth. For instance, those at Ambit Capital estimate a compounded growth of 21.5 per cent in sales and 36 per cent in net profit over FY14-17, implying an operating earnings' margin expansion of 447 basis points in this period, largely led by niche opportunities in the US and Hydrochloroquine (Plaquenil). The approvals anticipated in niche segments in the US are in transdermals, nasal sprays and controlled release products.Further, analysts are also expecting acceleration of growth in India. Domestic growth has already picked up to high double-digits as the impact of the new drug pricing policy fizzles out.Some brokerages like Sharekhan have raised their earnings estimates by six per cent and seven per cent for FY2016 and FY2017, respectively, in view of better traction in the US generic business, potential from the launch of the hepatitis-C drug in India and product ramp-up in other key markets, including business from joint ventures.
