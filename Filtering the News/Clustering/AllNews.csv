His forecast was almost spot on.', 'Fourth-quarter profit at Disney?s cable TV unit, the company?s single biggest profit contributor, slumped 1.2 percent to $1.24 billion, hurt by weak advertising sales and higher programming costs for baseball and football at ESPN.

Although profit rose, Hurricane Irma forced Disney to close its four Orlando, Florida, parks for two days and cancel three cruises. Domestic resort profits fell.', 'Capital spending in the current year will rise by about $1 billion, driven particularly by parks and resorts, Iger said.

You can settle your check with the Meituan app, book a karaoke room across town, select a song list and then hail a car for the trip over.', 'That makes it a serious contender in the super-app stakes, with capabilities to rivalWeChat, an app from messaging giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. -- ironically one of Meituan?s most prominent backers. The startup is already the world?s fourth mostvaluableand is emblematic of a new generation of up-and-comers thatthreatensa cozy duopoly enjoyed by Tencent and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.', 'Leading the drive is Wang Xing,\xa0a hard-charging 38-year-old who founded the$30 billionbehemoth. The inveterate entrepreneur is taking Meituan beyond its base of restaurant reviews and digital coupons into the alien territory of digital payments and even ride-hailing.\xa0Meituan already helps more than 4 million merchants hawk everything fromfood deliveryto apartment rentals and travel packages to\xa0a user base about the size of the U.S. population.', 'For now, the giant startup?s careful to emphasize it?s not trying to undermine Tencent, merely testing the waters and harnessing its user base. To that end, it?s opening its platform to third-parties and plotting an expansion into at least 10 new verticals,\xa0said Chen Shaohui, a senior vice president overseeing strategy.', '?Our services are location-based, that?s why we want our products to cover all aspects of life,?

Tencent now accounts for about 40 percent, according to research firm Analysys International.', 'Now Meituan has begun promoting the use of its own digital wallet on its app: it handles about a fifth of transactions from its 300 million-plus users.

There were no performances or elaborate tableaus that we have come to know of today. Very few policemen guarded the VIPs inside the stadium who mingled with each other and the crowds, especially Nehru who reportedly spent close to half an hour interacting with the commonfolk.', 'Across India?s small towns and villages,prabhat pheries,or morning rounds where people came together to chant songs before the sun rose to invoke good vibrations for a new day, were organised.', 'Outside the Rashtrapati Bhavan, amidst booming cheers by jubilant pools of people dressed in their finest, who had come to take part in the celebrations from adjoining states, the capital city had an air of festivity. People congratulated each other in the streets, raised slogans of ?Gandhiji ki Jai? and ?Vande Mataram? and visited Rajghat, the resting place of Mahatma Gandhi, in thousands.', 'Nearby, in Connaught Place, people of all age groups thronged the streets and crowded restaurants; shops remained illuminated through the day while the Rashtrapati Bhavan lit up at night, marking yet another first of a custom followed till this day. The atmosphere was electric and the spirit of freedom, infectious. India was the first Commonwealth country to have entirely come into its own; it was the biggest national ceremony of the 20th century.', 'Not all was good as there were several reports of anti-Republic Day celebrations from various regions across India. In Calcutta, communists attacked police officers with bombs and in Bombay, they protested that the workers? rights had been ignored in the constitution. In Hyderabad, there was an attempt to assassinate the Nizam, and in the capital city itself, the navy almost walked out of the parade!', 'Under the sea-faring British Empire, the navy was understandably the foremost of the three Armed Forces. Today, it can be argued that the honour lies with the army but in 1950, it was still a matter of contention. During the rehearsals for the first parade, the Navyfound itselfplaced after the last and comparatively huge contingent of the Army. When they protested, they were not taken seriously.', 'Until one day, during a routine rehearsal closer to 26 January, the Lt Commander and officer-in-charge of the Navy Contingent, Inder Singh, ordered the troops to march off the ground in protest. Chaos ensued and within fifteen minutes, senior army forces including the then Brigadier arrived at Irwin Amphitheatre to request the Navy to rejoin the parade, but this time in the lead. The offer was accepted, and that?s where the Navy marched on the final day.', 'From 1955 onwards, the venue of the celebrations was shifted to Rajpath, giving birth to an increasingly spectacular ceremony that remains a defining moment in the lives of all Indians each year, an event of national pride that displays the might and diversity of India: the Republic Day parade as we know it now.', 'It can be argued that the values encapsulated in the Constitution have eroded significantly in today?s political and cultural environment, in which case we need only look back at Dr Prasad?s words at the Irwin Amphitheatre 68 years ago for a glimmer of hope and rejuvenated enthusiasm: ?We must re-dedicate ourselves on this [Republic] day to the peaceful but sure realisation of the dream that had inspired the father of our nation and the other captains and soldiers of our freedom struggle, the dream of establishing a classless, co-operative, free and happy society. We must remember that this is more a day of dedications than of rejoicing ? dedication to the glorious task of making the peasants and workers, the toilers and the thinkers fully free, happy and cultured.?', '(We Indians have much to talk about these days.

His team has also interviewed CIA Director Mike Pompeo, NBC News reported.', 'Those high-level officials all have some degree of knowledge about events surrounding Trump?s decisions to fire Comey and Michael Flynn, his first national security adviser.', '?Clearly the names that are coming out now indicate that we?re into the obstruction of justice side of it,? said\xa0Stanley Twardy, a former U.S. attorney for Connecticut who?s now a white-collar criminal defense lawyer at the law firm Day Pitney LLP. ?He?s now getting people who are closest to the president, closest to the issues.?', 'Next, Mueller is expected to schedule an interview with Trump in coming weeks to discuss those events, according to a person familiar with the matter.', '?I?m looking forward to it,? Trump said of a meeting with Mueller, which he suggested may happen in about two to three weeks. He told reporters at the White House Wednesday that ?I would love to do it? and ?I would do it under oath? even though his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton wasn?t sworn in when she was interviewed in 2016 over her use of private emails as secretary of state.', 'Even if Mueller wraps up the obstruction probe, other elements of his investigation -- such as whether Trump or anyone close to him helped Russia interfere in the 2016 presidential election or broke any other laws -- are likely to continue for months more, said two officials who asked to remain anonymous speaking about the probe.', '?There?s no collusion whatsoever,?

The Washington Post reported that the conversation with McCabe is of interest to Mueller.', 'Mueller was appointed in May and, to date, has indicted Trump?s former campaign chairman and another campaign aide, as well as secured guilty pleas from Flynn and another former Trump adviser.', 'Even if evidence supports an obstruction of justice charge against Trump, however, it?s far from clear whether Mueller would bring a criminal case on those grounds. No sitting president has ever faced such a charge and it?s unknown if a case could proceed legally.', '?I don?t think Mr. Mueller would ever try to make legal precedent at the expense of a sitting president in the context of an obstruction of justice charge,? Twardy said. He said the biggest concern for Trump in an interview is probably the risk of committing perjury, as Mueller will cross-check his comments and recollection against the testimony and evidence he?s obtained from Coats, Comey, Flynn, Sessions and others.', '?He wants to hear Trump?s side of the story,? Twardy said. ?It will be important for him to look at Trump?s state of mind.?', 'Instead of pursuing criminal charges, Mueller could refer any findings to the Republican-controlled Congress, where a number of inquiries are under way.', 'But as Mueller?s probe has closed in on Trump, his Republican allies -- especially on the House Intelligence Committee -- have amplified their attacks on the FBI and the Russia investigation that Trump has often dismissed as a ?witch hunt.? The Republican lawmakers allege that the investigation was started on a misleading pretense and has been tainted by anti-Trump bias.', 'Another House investigation, being conducted jointly by the Judiciary Committee and the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, has focused on the FBI?s decision to drop a criminal case in 2016 involving Clinton?s emails, and the role that partisan bias by FBI personnel may have played in that investigation.', 'Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley has also pursued bias allegations against the FBI over its handling of the Clinton and Trump probes, but he has defended Mueller?s investigation.', '?I expect Mueller to do his job,? Grassley said Wednesday. ?His job is to do the investigation? and go where the facts take him.', 'After wrapping up interviews with the most senior officials, the next step for Mueller?s team will be to write a prosecutorial memorandum to evaluate the law and the facts and, based on that, make a recommendation, said Michael Weinstein, a former Justice Department trial attorney who?s now a white-collar defense lawyer with Cole Schotz P.C.', '?Traditionally when you are interviewing people at that level you are doing so at the end of the investigation,? Weinstein said. ?They have already established what they think are the facts and are now looking to see if these individuals are going to provide consistency with those facts or possibly take a different view of what the special counsel has.?', '?They will have a meeting to discuss what they have, whether the facts revealed a violation of the law and, if the answer is yes, does it justify bringing charges or a referral to Congress for a filing of some obstruction,? he said. ?Unless something earth-shattering comes out, Mueller is likely already thinking through what his next step is, and that could take a couple weeks.?', '', '', '', '©2018 Bloomberg L.P.']"

The push is the first of a package of programs, including a long-awaited property tax, poised to unfold over several years to rein in one of the world?s wildest real estate markets.', '?China?s property market is on the brink of tremendous change,?\xa0said Shen Jianguang, chief Asia economist at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong.\xa0?The push for rental properties shows a new model is starting to emerge.?', 'Xi is leveraging his immense power to try to solve a problem that?s dogged policy makers around the globe: spiraling property prices in major metropolitan areas that have fueled rising inequality. The aim seems to be a new market model, somewhere between the capitalist frenzy that sent home prices in Shanghai and Beijing rocketing ever higher and the Communist system where dwellings were allocated by work units.', 'Establishing a vibrant rental market will help to defuse the risks from ?irrational? home prices, said Deng Yongheng, of the University of Wisconsin, who helped carry out a study that showed a 1,538 percent gain in land prices in Beijing from 2004 to 2016.\xa0The long-term effects could range from driving consolidation among developers to fueling consumer spending as people pay less for housing, Wang Tao, an economist for UBS Group AG, wrote Thursday.', 'Around China, large rental complexes are being completed, under construction or in planning, and funding for such projects is being made available.\xa0The changes may alter developers? businesses, shake up government revenue and help make more Chinese citizens, like Germans, renters for life.', 'In theory, a thriving rental market would add housing supply and help stabilize prices after a 13-year property rally. The old model that prioritized home ownership encouraged ?a lot of speculation and crazy price gains -- and that model is coming to an end,? said Rosealea Yao, an analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics in Beijing.', 'City governments from Beijing to Shanghai have earmarked public land to auction to property companies that would develop rental projects only. Country Garden Holdings Co., China?s largest developer by sales, has announced plans to make 1 million units available over three years. Banks are offering credit lines to developers for financing rental projects, and the Shanghai Stock Exchange is encouraging the creation of investment products backed by rental income.', 'Xi is trying to alter the popular belief that property is a one-way bet, since any short-lived declines in prices have inevitably been followed by booms. Homeownership rates in China are among the highest in the world, at almost 90 percent, according to Cushman and Wakefield Inc. People also buy young. Parents oftenhelptheir sons buy a place as a prerequisite for marriage.', 'Rentals, meanwhile, have been a hard sell, in part because of limited tenant rights and the low quality of much of the stock, with some units even lacking their own bathrooms and kitchens.', 'Even if the new policies can help change that mindset, challenges abound. First, China?s leaders have to ensure they?re able to tame the market without tanking home prices. They?ll also have to balance other underlying drivers pointing to slowing demand. And officials would need to drop an old habit of letting prices boom whenever the economy needs a boost.', 'Still, the government?s backing means that the size of China?s rental market could drive annual rental payments to 4.2 trillion yuan ($658 billion) by 2030, almost half of total home sales in 2017, according to estimates from Orient Securities Co.', 'Here are some of the steps taken by cities, developers and others to support the push:', 'Some 95 percent of 395 units offered in the initial phases have been rented mostly to individuals under 32, said Vanke?s Shanghai head for rental business Yan Yong, with rents ranging from 2,600 to 3,400 yuan a month ($407 to $532).\xa0Not bad for a city where home costs have soared to levels rivaling theworld?s priciestmarket, Hong Kong.', 'While analysts say it could take years for the changes to take hold, some caution against underestimating the resolve of Xi, perhaps China?s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong.', 'Read more: A QuickTake explainer on China?s housing market', '?When Xi started his anti-graft campaign years ago, people didn?t expect it to be so powerful, but it proved to be beyond imagination,? said Mizuho?s Shen. ?Now, most people still hold the belief that home prices will never fall, and speculation is rampant.

Another option -- which Trump also considered, according to the Times -- would be to fire Rosenstein and pressure his successor to dismiss Mueller, repeating the steps as needed until finding someone willing to carry out his wishes.

So, the average that we are looking at is 4-5 percent. If you have EPS at only 4-5 percent and prices run-up, it is leading to a very high PE.', 'But the market is essentially pricing in a rebound in the cyclicals. In the next 3-4 years, you will have very high earnings growth in cyclicals, probably led by banks which will no longer have to do as much provisioning. Infrastructure spending and higher disposable income will also aid cyclicals. So, these are a few areas where we think there will be a spurt in earnings. Therefore, over the next 3-4 years, the PE should normalise a bit. That is the hypothesis the market is based on today.', 'There are 2-3 factors which are driving it. Firstly, we have been seeing a growing number of investors, and the longer they stay, the more maturity and the experience they gather. If you have gone through previous cycles, you know that you just have to ride out the cycle. Secondly, the advisory and the distribution community has grown significantly over the last few years. So, we hope that there are a lot of investors who have someone to talk to during times of volatility, which has been missing over the last year. But as volatility returns, we are hoping that the investors will call their advisors or distributors and take guidance. Thirdly, a large part of the growth in the industry is SIP-led. One certainly hopes that it will be much longer and not as volatile in terms of flows.

Weak productivity and slow labor-force expansion will also pose hurdles in the longer term, and higher borrowing costs could crimp gains as well.', '?The economy continues to hum along,? said Ryan Sweet, an economist at Moody?s Analytics Inc. in West Chester, Pennsylvania, who accurately projected the 2.6 percent figure. ?This is far from doom and gloom. Businesses are investing aggressively and consumers continue to spend at a very strong pace. We got a bit spoiled by 3 percent-plus growth in the last couple of quarters, but that streak was eventually going to come to an end.?', 'Fourth-quarter GDP was dragged down mainly because the trade deficit widened, as imports rose at double the pace of exports. Net exports subtracted 1.13 percentage points from GDP growth, the most in a year. A change in inventories subtracted 0.67 percentage point, the most since early 2017. A separate report on Friday showed that the nation?s merchandise-trade gap widened in December to the biggest since 2008.', 'For a better sense of underlying domestic demand, economists look at\xa0final sales to domestic purchasers, which strip out inventories and trade, the two most volatile components of GDP. Such sales grew 4.3 percent last quarter, the most since 2014, after a 1.9 percent increase.', 'For the full year, GDP, the value of all goods and services produced, grew 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, the Commerce Department report also showed. On that basis, it was the strongest annual performance since 2014?s 2.7 percent. The expansion is now in its ninth year and is poised to become the country?s second-longest on record later in 2018.', 'Fourth-quarter GDP growth forecasts ranged from 2.2 percent to 3.8 percent, according to the Bloomberg survey. Household purchases, which account for about 70 percent of the economy, were projected to rise 3.7 percent, according to the survey median. The latest gain in consumer spending added 2.58 percentage points to growth.', 'Another standout was corporate demand. Business equipment investment expanded at a 11.4 percent annualized rate after a 10.8 percent gain in the prior period. That added 0.62 percentage point to fourth-quarter growth.', 'The economy also got a boost from housing for the first time in three quarters. Residential construction increased at a 11.6 percent annualized rate, contributing 0.42 percentage-point to growth.', 'While the boost from tax cuts and a strong labor market may provide support to the economy, growth may be less robust. GDP gains are projected to cool to 2.5 percent as early as this quarter, according to economists? forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.', 'One reason is that household spending will be hard pressed to accelerate further.\xa0Wage gains remain tepid even with steady hiring and the lowest unemployment rate since 2000. Gasoline expenses are ticking up, consumer debt is rising, and borrowing costs are projected to keep rising gradually as the Fed tightens monetary policy.', 'First-quarter GDP has also been limited in recent years by so-called residual seasonality, or quirks in the data that the government is trying to address.', '', '', '', '©2018 Bloomberg L.P.']"

Yet consumer spending jumped 3.8 percent, the best in more than a year, business equipment investment grew at the fastest pace in three years, and housing made a strong contribution. The more-volatile categories of trade and inventories together lopped 1.8 percentage points off of growth.', 'The economy had solid support from various sectors coming into 2018, and the president?s move to cut taxes will help underpin demand. Nonetheless, the pace of household purchases --\xa0which account for about 70 percent of the economy -- probably won?t repeat its recent performance anytime soon amid still-modest wage gains and higher debt loads.', 'The report also shows how a widening trade gap can take a bite out of GDP: While strong domestic demand boosted imports last quarter, exports failed to keep pace even with a global growth pickup and a weaker dollar. Federal Reserve interest-rate increases could also weigh on the expansion, already in its ninth year.', '?The details are much better than the headline,? said Tom Simons, senior economist at Jefferies LLC. ?The more fundamental elements of growth were quite strong in the fourth quarter. Both on the consumer and the business side, there?s a lot of momentum.? At the same time, ?trade might be a more persistent weakness.?', 'Had GDP met forecasts, it would have been the third straight quarter of 3 percent-or-better growth, the longest streak since 2005. Higher business confidence since Trump was elected has probably played a role in driving more corporate investment, and lower taxes may extend the resurgence.', 'The bigger trade deficit during the quarter reflected imports rising at double the pace of exports. Net exports subtracted 1.13 percentage points from GDP, the most in a year. The gap between merchandise exports and imports in December was the biggest since 2008.', 'Ongoing depreciation of the dollar would make it difficult to rein in the trade deficit, which Trump has pledged to shrink. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said this week that the weak dollar was good for U.S. trade, pushing the greenback to a three-year low amid fears the U.S. was stoking a trade war and was willing to use the currency to win it.', 'To get a better sense of underlying domestic demand, economists look at final sales to domestic purchasers, which strip out inventories and trade from GDP. Such sales grew 4.3 percent last quarter, the most since 2014.', '?The economy continues to hum along,? said Ryan Sweet, an economist at Moody?s Analytics Inc. in West Chester, Pennsylvania, who accurately projected 2.6 percent GDP growth. ?This is far from doom and gloom. Businesses are investing aggressively and consumers continue to spend at a very strong pace. We got a bit spoiled by 3 percent-plus growth in the last couple of quarters, but that streak was eventually going to come to an end.?', 'GDP forecasts in the Bloomberg survey ranged from 2.2 percent to 3.8 percent.\xa0Growth was 3.2 percent in the third quarter and 3.1 percent in the three months before that.', 'Growth also got a\xa00.42 percentage point boost from housing, the first contribution in three quarters, as residential construction increased at an 11.6 percent pace. Business equipment investment expanded at a 11.4 percent rate.', 'The latest gain in consumer spending added 2.58 percentage points to the GDP results. Even with steady hiring and the lowest unemployment rate since 2000, wage increases remain tepid, one reason economists expect households may take a breather from splurging this quarter.', '?We?ve had some pretty solid numbers here in the report, but real disposable personal income, not so much.

He made headlines in 2015 by offering to pay college tuition for his employees? children and the following year offered as much as $20,000 to help employees pay for their weddings.

The project created 600 full-time jobs from design through construction."", '?Accomplishing year five on day one presented a really big challenge for us,?\xa0says M.

The biggest sphere is 90 feet high and 130 feet wide. Inside, visitors first notice the warm, moist air, about 72 degrees and 60 percent humidity, compared with the 30 percent humidity in a typical office. Eyeglasses fog over and sweat beads on foreheads while bodies adjust. Just inside the doors is a five-story ?living wall?\xa0cascading with greenery. The climate varies throughout so visitors can find a ?micro-climate?\xa0to their liking. The temperature swings as much as five degrees, a big difference in the humid environment, and ventilation systems simulate an outdoor breeze.', ""Wi-Fi is available for those looking to work, as well as small meeting spaces like the ?bird's nest,? perched along the suspension bridge beneath Rubi that resembles a tree fort swaying in the branches. The spheres can accommodate 800 people at a time, and Amazon will use employee badges to monitor time spent inside and make sure no one hogs the tree fort. Management wants employees to relax, just not too much."", ""Besides creating a park-like setting where workers can recharge, the spheres will serve as a recruiting tool, says John Schoettler, who runs Amazon's global real estate division and oversaw the project.

All told, Dell had around $48.5 billion of bonds and loans as of Nov. 3. Before it went private in 2013, it had less than $7 billion of debt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.', 'Now changes to U.S. corporate tax law could make it more expensive for some corporations to borrow, including Dell, and boost other expenses. That?s painful for a company that?s already losing money.\xa0Taking steps such as going public again would help the company raise equity and pay down debt. Dell spokesman Dave Farmer declined to comment.', '?Tax reform threw them a curveball,? said Jordan Chalfin, an analyst at CreditSights. ?It put a wrench in their deleveraging plans.?', 'Under the new law, Dell can only deduct interest expenses equal to about 30 percent of a measure of its income. Losing part of that deduction could possibly end up costing it somewhere in the region of $100 million a year,\xa0Chalfin said. In late November, Dell was among companies thatsigned onto a letter to Senate leaders opposing a stricter version of the deduction limitation than what ultimately become law.', 'Tax law changes could hit the company in another way too: Dell has to pay taxes on cash and other assets held overseas, which could amount to around $6 billion over time, starting with about $480 million for each of the first five years, according to estimates from CreditSights analysts led by Chalfin.', 'Dell said on an analyst call last month when it released earnings that it will not comment on the impacts of the new tax law but that it expects them to be manageable. The company has about $3 billion of bonds maturing this year, and another $4.35 billion in 2019, not to mention the more than $2 billion of loans coming due over that period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.', 'Rising interest rates over time may weigh on its interest expenses, too. Around $12.9 billion of the company?s loans as of November 3 were tied to the floating rate known as the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. That rate has gone up 92 basis points since the EMC deal closed, effectively adding more than $115 million to Dell?s annual interest expense, if the company did not hedge that risk. The company has been mitigating that extra expense by negotiating lower rates on some of its loans.', 'One other key factor: the Dell buyout was partially funded by private equity firm Silver Lake, which put up additional money to help pay for the EMC acquisition, bringing its total stake to around $2.4 billion. That firm may be looking to get out, said Abhey Lamba, an analyst at Mizuho Securities USA. Silver Lake owns around 24 percent of Dell.', '""Whenever private equity gets into deals like this they really need an exit strategy,"" said Lamba, who covers VMware, a public company of which Dell owns a controlling stake, and rates the shares neutral.', 'Silver Lake declined to comment.', 'Dell is considering selling shares to the public, or possibly a transaction with software maker VMware Inc., according to people familiar with the company?s thinking.\xa0Dell?s board is meeting later this month and will discuss the various options, said the people, who did not want to be named because the discussions are private.', 'Another option Dell is eyeing is a public share sale for its Pivotal Software Inc. cloud-computing venture. Dell met with bankers last year to discuss that possibility and was told the company could fetch a valuation of $5 billion to $7 billion, said one of the people. Still, any Pivotal offering may wait until the company has converted more of its business into wider-margin software and subscriptions and away from less-profitable services businesses, the person said.', 'Pivotal, a cloud software and services firm, was once a joint venture of VMware, EMC and General Electric Co. and became part of Dell after the EMC acquisition.', 'VMware spokesman Michael Thacker declined to comment.', '', '', '', '©2018 Bloomberg L.P.']"

The US move to applytariffson steel and aluminiumimportsto protect its domestic industry resulted in China issuing an intent to impose duties on agricultural goods worth $3 billion imported from the US.', 'Following the publication of the US Trade Representative (USTR) report of its investigation of China, the Trump administration decided to impose 25% tariff on over 1,300 products coming from China, as per the list announced on April 3. These items account for $46 billion of USimportsfrom China.', 'The next day, China announced a list of 106 US products that would be subject to the same tariff rate, impacting almost $50 billion worth of Chineseimportsfrom the US.', 'If, after due process, all thesetariffsare instituted, they would price higher about 15% of bilateral goods trade.', 'April witnessed further trade measures from the two countries directed at each other. The US banned its companies from selling components to Chinese telecom equipment manufacturer ZTE for seven years, citing violations of sanctions against Iran. Anti-dumping deposits were imposed on USexportsof sorghum to China, its major market by far for the product. The US then threatenedtariffson another $100 billionimportsfrom China.', 'Such steps have significant implications for global trade. The US is the worlds largest importer of goods at $2.2 trillion and the second largest exporter with $1.4 trillion, while China ranks top inexportswith $2.1 trillion and second inimportsat $1.4 trillion as of 2016. Merchandise worth $637 billion was exchanged between the two countries in 2017, with two-way flows including services exceeding $711 billion. Volatility resulting from uncertainty about the implementation of threatened tariff measures has hit markets.', 'USTR report', 'The USTR report, on which the recent round of tariff hikes is based, was initiated in August 2017 under Section 301 of the US Trade Act following long-standing complaints from US companies about being pressurised to share technology with China in return for market access. The findings imply that the Chinese government deploys unfair, opaque and unwritten ways to compel American enterprises to open up their proprietary technologies.', 'The report also alleges that China supports and incentivises acquisitions of and investments in US technology firms to gain intellectual property.', 'One key claim of the report is that the Chinese government indulges in unauthorised intrusions into US commercial computer networks and cyber theft of intellectual property belonging to US enterprises. The USTR claims are refuted by China.', 'The US-China trade war is thus a tussle for technology leadership and strategic dominance. Chinese investments in US technology firms, too, have been on the US radar.  The rapid progress made by China in so-called Industry 4.0 technologies is causing concern in the US. Given this technology contest, it is likely that trade confrontation of the two countries may continue.', 'Indias trade with the US, China', 'For India, the US is its largest export market and second largest source ofimportswith total trade in goods at $66 billion (April-February 2017-18), as per official data.', 'China remains by far Indias largest import partner with close to $70 billion of goods purchased from the country in the first 11 months of the fiscal year. However, Indianexportsto China were less than $12 billion.', 'If the tariff barriers imposed by the US and China play out as announced, global trade could contract, impacting Indias recent upturn inexports.', 'A possibility could be that the US and China would consider third producers, including India, for their import necessities. Reportedly,Indiahas offered to sell soybean and sugar to China during the Strategic Economic Dialogue held in Beijing in April.', 'Indiasexportsof tariff-impacted products', 'Machinery, mechanical appliances and electrical equipment account for $34.2 billion of the 1,300 affected USimportsfrom China. Looking at US import items from China valued at over $500 million, it is found that Indiasexportsto the US of these items (at four-digit level) in 2016 were very limited (see table below).', 'Only four of the 15 items aggregated more than $100,000 and none came in over $300,000 value.', 'It is, therefore, unlikely that US demand of these products fromIndiawould pick up considerably in the short term.', 'Regarding Chineseimportsfrom the US on which retaliatorytariffsare proposed, the top category is transportation goods at $27.6 billion, followed by vegetable products ($13.7 billion) and plastics and rubber ($3.5 billion).', 'For all but two of the items for which imported value is over $500 million (at six-digit HS Code), Indiasexportsto China are nil or negligible (Table 2 below). The only exceptions are cotton and vehicle parts.', 'Thus,Indiawould probably not be considered by China as a potential replacement source for its USimportsof these goods.', 'Implications for India', 'The above analysis shows thatIndiawould not see much positive trade diversion coming its way from the ongoing US-China trade spat. For one, with about 15% of bilateral trade slated to suffer from higher tariffs, the first and second round spillover impact on world trade from lower bilateral trade would be inimical to Indianexports.', 'Second, the high-value imported goods on whichtariffsare proposed by both countries are not significant in Indias export profile for the two partners. In some cases, such as electrical equipment and machinery,Indialacks manufacturing capacity. In others, as for example, soybeans, Chinas import barriers for Indian products have preventedIndiafrom accessing its market.', 'Three, given the current US stance, there is a risk of further trade barriers on USimportsfromIndia.Indiahas been placed on the Priority Watch List in the USTR Special 301 Report for intellectual property rights (IPR) implementation. Its foreign exchange policies are also under US watch. H1B visa regulations have been made tougher, and fewer Indians are applying for them.

These are part of the overall US protectionist trade sentiments and policies, which could escalate, depending on domestic reaction and global retaliation.', 'On the Chinese side, there has been a reluctance to address Indias trade concerns, including for agricultural products. At the meeting of trade ministers in March, there were no significant outcomes. Hopefully, the upcoming visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to China would take up trade issues.', 'Investment dimension', 'There is some potential for positive diversion toIndiaon the investment side. Chinas foreign direct investment (FDI) in the US has dropped considerably in 2017 over the previous year. With Chinese firms taking positions in Indias technology sector, there is a possibility for higher inflows from that direction.', 'US investments inIndiafell between 2015-16 and 2016-17 and stayed muted in the April-December 2017-18 period at a cumulative total of $22 billion from April 2000 to December 2017. Its outward FDI was $299 billion in 2016 alone.', 'Strong efforts would be required to attract the US and Chinese FDI toIndia.', 'Technology implications', 'With technology development and intellectual property rights (IPR) as issues of contention,Indiawill need to be watchful regarding its own position in the evolving Industry 4.0 technologies.Indiacompares well with China in terms of English language proficiency and cultural connect, raising less anxiety about data security and IPR loss.', 'As long asIndiaadheres to a strong IPR regime and continues to encourage non-resident patent applications, it would stand out as a reliable technology partner for the future. However, Chinas focused and accelerated approach towards the target of technology dominance should incite deeper strategic thinking in Indian policy circles to avoidIndiabeing marginalised in the technology leadership competition between the US and China.', 'Future direction', 'The US-China trade disputes are part of two larger developments. The first is the general context of strategic geopolitical tensions exhibited within an economic and technological expression. Second is the waning gains that overseas enterprises perceive in a Chinese economy where the trade-off between market access and IPR loss is yielding lower margins.', 'It is unclear which direction the trade tensions could take in coming months. On the one hand, there is the possibility of de-escalation of trade measures and counter-measures, which would require a period of intensive negotiations between the two sides. On the other, the increased clamour from different constituencies (primarily in the US) could lead to further rounds of offensive policies.', 'For Indias policymakers, the fact that the items of interest to the worlds largest traders figure insignificantly in its export basket with these markets flags the countrys continued low penetration of world markets.', 'The Indian government would need to ensure a strategic approach to the many dimensions of the export endeavour in this evolving trade scenario and accelerate export competitiveness in mission mode to reinstate its efficacy as a growth driver for the country. It must also continue to take measures to encourage its R&D engagement and boost technology industries.']"

It also means till then I do not have any threat.', 'Four years later, it seems as if Modi may have to re-examine his statement. Cracks have begun to appear in the perceived aura of invincibility of the Modi-led BJP. The main reasons behind this are the BJPs electoral setbacks in the Chitrakoot assembly by-election in Madhya Pradesh in November last year, the fierce resistance it faced from a resurgent Congress in Gujarat in the following month and finally the huge margins by which it recently lost the by-elections in Rajasthan, UP (Gorakhpur, Phulpur) and Bihar.', 'Though its now clear that 2019 wont be a cakewalk for the BJP, Modi and company still remain the favorites to win in 2019. Before understanding how the power equations of 2019 are shaping up, lets go back to the 2014 victory of BJP. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP won 205 seats out of its overall tally of 282 seats from the 12 northern and western states (of Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh). This still remains a make or break region for the BJP. It seems highly unlikely that it will be able to retain its 2014 tally. A resurgent Congress in Punjab, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and a possible SP-BSP-Congress alliance, growing anti-incumbency will mean that the BJP may suffer from a loss of 50-60 seats in the region.', 'So, how can the BJP make up for this large decline in the other zones? The BJP has already peaked in the North, West and has also made an impressive debut in the Northeast. So, the South is important for its 2019 Lok Sabha strategy. The five southern states  Andhra Pradesh (AP), Telangana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala  and one Union Territory of Pondicherry together send 130 MPs to the Lok Sabha. Despite the Modi wave in 2014, the BJP won just 20 seats from the region, of which 17 are from Karnataka, two from AP and one from Tamil Nadu. Sources say that the BJPs chief election strategistAmit Shahhas identified 50-60 winnable seats in the Southern states. IfNarendra Modiwants to be back in South Block in 2019, then the BJP has to make inroads in the South to offset its losses in the North and West.', 'Traditionally, the BJP has failed to make any inroads in the South because its largely seen as a North Indian party and its trump card of Hindutva doesnt work in the region. Its important to try and understand the prevalent political situation in the southern states and interpret what picture may emerge in 2019. Both the national parties are marginal players in the South and they will have to rely on the hegemonic regional outfits in various states. The political mood is fast changing due to a number of local and national issues such as the resentment against the fund allocations to the southern states by the 15th Finance Commission, the Cauvery water dispute, special category status (SCS) demand by Andhra, the political turmoil in Tamil Nadu and the upcomingKarnataka Assembly Elections.', 'Karnataka: Gateway to the South', 'Karnataka is the only state below the Vindhyas where the saffron party once had a full-fledged government on its own. The BJP has been traditionally strong in the coastal areas of the state which is the hotbed of Hindutva politics in the South and enjoys some support in urban areas as well. In his Mysuru rally, BJP chiefAmit Shahdeclared recently, Winning the elections here will open the door for the BJP to the southern part of the country. A win in Karnataka will be a shot in the arm for the BJPs southern ambitions, paving its way for gaining more seats in the South in 2019. A BJP win in the Assembly Elections next year may mean that the BJP can realistically set itself a target of winning at least 20 out of the 28 seats in the state in 2019.', 'However, at this moment it seems like Siddaramaiah, in spite of the anti-incumbency against him, holds the edge in the elections. The Congress is fighting the elections like a regional party and in a smart shift of strategy Siddaramaiah has relied heavily on Kannadiga sub nationalism to counter BJPs nationalism, by raising issues like local language, Kannada imposition, separate state flag etc. One of the leading reasons behind the BJPs rise in Karnataka was because the dominant Lingayat community supported the BJP in the 90s. However, Siddaramaiahs move to identify the Lingayats as a separate religion is a masterstroke that can erode the saffron parts Lingayat voter base.', 'If the BJP manages to win Karnataka, it will gain momentum going into an election season which includes four assembly elections and the 2019 showdown. A win in Karnataka will help the BJP boost its standing and thus, it will stand a chance to stitch together a regional alliance of smaller regional parties in the South or it will at least ensure a dent in the Congresss winning credentials and thus prevent any major regional outfit from joining any anti-BJP front headed by the Congress.', 'Tamil Nadu: An alliance in the making?', 'After the death of J. Jayalalithaa, the Dravidian state of Tamil Nadu has been in a constant state of flux and political turmoil. The current political landscape of the state seems like a political potpourri. With Kamal Hassans Makkal Needhi Maiam making its entry on the Dravidian political scene, the AIADMK led by EPS and OPS treading cautiously, Dinakaran making his own moves and launching AMMK and even Rajinikanth being ready to take the political plunge, the BJP will be hoping to cut deals with one of these entities to gain some seats in the state. The BJP on its own is absolutely irrelevant in the state. The Dravidian politics of the state is based on Tamil cultural nationalism and that explains why the BJP has found no takers in the state. The BJP in the past has piggybacked on the DMK and the AIADMK and has tried its best to reach out to both of them and stitch an alliance with them on several occasions in the past four years, but it has failed to do so.', 'It seems as if the BJP wont be able to make inroads in the state or woo any of the two major Dravidian politics in the foreseeable future. The BJPs best bet is to join hands with Rajinikanth and hope to win at least five seats in 2019.  The BJP may have committed political hara-kiri with its unsympathetic stand on the Cauvery dispute. The slogans of Modi, go back may not be easily forgotten and no Tamil Nadu party may ally with the BJP, which is largely seen as the villain on the Cauvery issue.', 'Kerala: Opening account', 'For decades, the BJP has failed to make any significant electoral inroads in Kerala despite the strong presence of the RSS in the state since 1942. The RSS is very powerful, especially in the northern parts and in Kasaragod. Christians and Muslims comprise almost 45% of the population. The Muslims are with the Indian Union Muslim League, the Christians with the Congress and the Communist Party has been patronised by the upper caste and lower caste Hindus. The BJP made notable gains in terms of its vote share in the 2016 assembly polls where it polled almost 15% of the votes. The BJP has come up with an ambitious Mission 11 plan in Kerala, under which  the party would concentrate on all 20 Lok Sabha seats in the state, with special attention to 11 segments from where the party polled over two lakh votes each in the 2016 Assembly Elections.', 'Given the composition of population, the BJPs aim of making a mark in Kerala in 2019 seems difficult but not impossible. The BJPs best bet is to try and consolidate the Hindu vote in the state and also woo a chunk of the Christian votes, which has traditionally supported the Congress. The BJP has used its new poster boy of Hindutva, Yogi Adityanath  to campaign in Kerala, which explains what its 2019 strategy will be. The BJP has formed an alliance with the Bharatiya Dharma Jana Sena, a party which has some support from the backward Ezhava community.  It seems as if the BJP at best can hope to open its account in the state in 2019 polls. However, any form of direct or indirect understanding between the Congress and the Left will be a blessing in disguise for the BJP as it would occupy the space of the principal opposition party, thus helping it win some additional seats.', 'Battlefor the Telugu states', 'The two regional parties Yuvajana Shramika Rythu Congress Party (YSRCP) and the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) undoubtedly hold the edge in Andhra Pradesh while the two national parties  Congress and BJP  are almost irrelevant in the state. In a stunning reversal of fortunes, the BJP is most likely to draw a blank in the state in the state because of its divorce with the TDP. The BJP on several occasions has tried to reach out to the YSRCP and the PM even met Jaganmohan Reddy last year which many believe angered Chandrababu Naidu and ultimately lead to the TDP severing its ties with the BJP. The best case scenario for the BJP will be to ensure that none of the two parties allies with the Congress. The BJP can always hope for a post poll alliance with TDP if it falls short of the 272 mark in 2019. The biggest cause for concern for the saffron party is that the TDP, YSRCP have been so far able to paint it as the villain in the SCS saga.', 'Even Telangana isnt likely to provide any cushion to the BJP in 2019. K. Chandrashekar Rao looks pretty much in control of Telangana and with Congress being the primary opposition party, it seems as if the BJP wont be able to open its account in the state. Rao is now looking for national role by trying to form a non-Congress, non-BJP third front. It is surprising that the Telangana CM who had committed himself to working in Hyderabad till he achieved the goal of Bangaru (Golden) Telangana is now trying to do a Devegowda in 2019.', 'BJPs formula for 2019', 'The math for 2019 as far as the BJP is concerned is quite simple. It has to gain in the East, Northeast and South to compensate the losses that it will suffer in the North and the West. The BJP can realistically hope to make only marginal gains in the eastern states of Odisha and West Bengal and at best can double its tally in the Northeast.', 'The BJP has made an astonishing electoral debut in the Northeast because of some smart strategies, alliances, backroom deals and defections. Congresss loss has turned out to be BJPs gain as the ex-Congressman and now BJPs blue-eyed boy in the Northeast Himanta Biswa Sarma has helped the BJP expand in the region. The BJP and its allies are in power today in all northeastern states barring Mizoram. BJP chiefAmit Shahhas set a target of winning 20 out of the 25 seats in the region in 2019. The BJP can realistically hope to win at least 15 seats in the region and thus almost double its 2014 tally.', 'After the BJPs history victory in Tripura,Amit Shahwhile addressing the media had said that the BJPs golden period has not yet started and that it will begin only when it emerges victorious in West Bengal, Odisha and Kerala. The statement perhaps best explains the importance of the eastern states of West Bengal and Odisha for the BJP. The two seats together have 63 Lok Sabha seats.', 'Naveen Patnaik has been the CM of Odisha since 2000. Congress, which has long been the principal opposition party is steadily losing ground and conceding  to the BJP. The BJP has emerged as the second largest party in the recent by-polls and Panchayat polls in the state. Internal squabbles in the ruling BJD and a lethargic, anaemic Congress provide ample opportunities for the BJP to grow in the state. It wont be a big surprise if the Congress draws a blank in Odisha in 2019 and the BJP wrests all the five seats from it.', 'Just like Odisha, in West Bengal, the BJP is dislodging the Congress and the Left and fast emerging as the main opposition to the ruling TMC. Mukul Roy, once number two in the TMC has joined the saffron party. The BJP seems to be aggressively pushing its Hindutva agenda in the state to consolidate the Hindu votes against the TMC. However, the TMC led by Mamta still enjoys a lot of support and the BJP can at best hope to win an additional three-five seats in 2019.', 'Thus, the BJPs gains and claims of expansion in the Northeast and in the eastern states of Bengal and Odisha appear only symbolic and it can only pickup 15-20 additional seats in the region in 2019.', 'The BJP can gain only 20 odd seats in the eastern and Northeastern states so it will still have to perform better in the south to make-up for the deficit. Its evident that Narendra Modis road to South Block in 2019 will pass through the Southern states. The BJP has emerged as an election winning colossus with an insatiable desire to expand and it has so far conquered the North, West and made an impressive debut in the northeast but South India will surely be a tough nut to crack.']"

In late March, it was reported that over 28 million people applied for about 90,000jobsin the Indian Railways. Even more recently, 200,000 applicants  including 423 with bachelors degrees in engineering, 167 MBAs, 543 postgraduates in commerce, 28 with BEds, 34 masters in computer science, 159 M.Scs, 25 with bachelors degrees in mass media and communication, and 167 BBAs  applied for 1,167jobsof police constables in Mumbai.', 'Clearly, much is not well on thejobmarket front even though there are claims by the government that the problem is not one of missingjobsbut missing data onjobs.The challenge ofjobsis especially acute because of the current and growing size of Indias young population.', 'According to a recent World Bank report: Every month, the working age increases by 1.3 million people and India must create 8.1 millionjobsa year to maintain its employment rate, which has been declining based on employment data analysed from 2005 to 2015, largely due to women leaving thejobmarket.', 'At one time, it was widely believed that Indias young population was a fantastic asset and would reap a handsome demographic dividend. Now, it is commonly acknowledged that Indias future is more uncertain and questions are being asked about the kind of economic contribution its young population can make. Half of Indias 1.3 billion people are below 25 and two-thirds are under 35. And they are desperately looking forjobs.', 'In theory, Indias young population should reap a demographic dividend for the country. However, for that to become a reality, two things are necessary. First, Indias young should be capable of doing thejobsthat are available in an era where advances in science and technology are bringing about dramatic changes in the kinds ofjobsthat are becoming available. Indias education sector  both primary and secondary education  does not inspire confidence in this regard. Employability reports of college graduates, including those with degrees in professional disciplines, such as engineering, present a dismal picture too. There is much truth to Indian Staffing Federations Rituparna Chakrabortys  statement that no one seems to have the time to ask the bigger question, i.e. of thejobsthat are still being created, how many of them are being filled? Alternately, however, the young should be prepared to work in more traditional sectors such as manufacturing which in turns draws attention to the second issue: that a sufficient number ofjobsmust be available or created in manufacturing for young people to be employed. The numbers cited above show that this is not happening.', 'That these are hard times for Indias young population is well-captured in Dreamers, a new book by the journalist Snigdha Poonam. More worryingly, however, the book provides frightening insights into what the future may look like for India. According to Poonam, the countrys young population share many of the cultural values of their grandparents such as social conservatism but the life goals of American teenagers, or certainly those of urban and upwardly-mobile Indians  money and fame  which are likely to prove elusive for most. Another way of saying the same thing differently is that India doesnt have ajobcrisis[but] a wage crisis  everyone who wants ajobhas a job, just doesnt have the wage they aspire for. Mix that with the distorted views of a growing section of Indias young about what it means to be an Indian and the glories of Indias pre-colonial and pre-Islamic past and things increasingly begin to look like a recipe for a coming social disaster.', 'Another worrisome pointer in the same direction is that there are reports about Indias young not seekingjobsor opting for voluntaryunemployment.According toNITI Aayogmember Bibek Debroy, who in mid-2017 had expressed concern about it, voluntaryunemploymentis largely about people unwilling to settle for jobs, particularly after having invested in education that do not give an acceptable salary. However, voluntaryunemploymentcan also refer to those young people who at one time looked forjobsand could either not get them or discovered that the kind of work they were required to do in theirjobwas not to their liking. In a more positive sense, voluntaryunemploymentcan also be about young people choosing to become entrepreneurs in preference to working for others, or choosing to study further in order to secure betterjobs.', 'According to reports, the numbers of those opting for voluntaryunemploymentis highest in less developed states with larger numbers of young people, such as Uttar Pradesh (UP), Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha. Mahesh Vyas, the Managing Director of Centre for MonitoringIndian Economy(CMIE), expressed the view that young people, who have nojobsand have even stopped looking forjobscould easily stray into unlawful activities thereby turning Indias demographic dividend into a demographic demon. But numbers alone should not be the only cause for worry. It is not inevitable that the voluntarily unemployed will opt for unlawful activities. What they do is shaped by the nature of political discourse in their state and the country. Even relatively smaller numbers of voluntarily unemployed in more developed states could take the path of unlawful activities when mobilised to that end by influential political leaders with the expectation that they would benefit from it.', 'In sum, tough times ahead for Indias young people have the potential to translate into hard times for the nations social harmony and peace.', 'Madhvi Gupta is an independent writer based in Goa.

Essentially, the country's large market size in any sector presents a compelling investment opportunity, and yet the average return available per user may challenge the viability of thebusinessmodel."", 'With rising incomes, immense growth opportunities will emerge in the coming decades across telecom, aviation and other such infrastructure sectors. The consumption of goods and services is expected to rise to levels approximating those of more developed markets such as China and the US.', ""Take, as examples, the case of optical fibre cable and airline seats per capita. The optical fibre cable (much needed for 5G technology deployment) kilometres per capita in India is currently at 0.09 vis-a-vis China's 0.87 (as per CRU). In 2014, the annual airline domestic seats per capita in India stood at 0.08 vis-a-vis 2.59 in the US (as per the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation, or CAPA)."", 'Bridging of the gaps in these infrastructure sectors is the opportunity investors must set their eyes on. Despite the low airline domestic seats per capita, CAPA maintains that, in terms of tickets sold, India is the third-largest and fastest-growing domestic aviation market in the world. This gives one an idea of thebusinessopportunity. With the expected increases in incomes in the foreseeable future, these opportunities will only become more attractive.', 'Despite a large aggregate market size, the lower per capita income in India leads to a low revenue per user. This phenomenon poses a challenge for prospective businesses. Vodafone presents an interesting case in this regard. In fiscal 2016-17, of its total global subscriber base of 341.7 million, 209 million were in India (about 61 per cent). Yet, revenue earned here was 6.16 billion euros, or just 12.9 percent of its total global revenue of 47.6 billion euros.', 'In abusinesssuch as telecom that requires significant capital expenditure, a low average revenue per user is a real challenge. The fact that the large subscriber base can deliver value in the future as the average revenue per user grows cannot compensate for the fact that sustaining businesses in the short to medium term can be confounding.', 'This apparent paradox of an attractivebusinessfrom a macro perspective beset with challenges at the micro level, is not unique to just the telecom sector in India. This is a challenge that businesses in general face in a country that has a large aggregate economy, but low per capita income.', 'The key to success forbusinessin India is determined by the ability of an investor to circumvent the divide between an opportunity at a macro level and the ground-level challenges. Strategies to succeed should revolve around both sides of the balance sheet. From an asset perspective, businesses need to potentially bundle services and products so that customers are willing to give the company a larger share of their wallet.', ""For example, for a telecombusinessthis could mean offering connectivity and entertainment as a package, a trend that is currently emerging. A second strategy could be to acquire the assets of or merge one's assets with another similar company to create economies of scale, a strategy Vodafone has adopted."", 'On the liability side of the balance sheet, businesses can innovate through prudent capital structure management to generate access to relatively inexpensive debt. Global interest rates are still at historic lows despite the recent rate hikes in the US. The global financial investor base is awash with liquidity and hence willing to provide high quality businesses attractive borrowing terms. A high-quality company in India can create a moat around itsbusinessby borrowing for the long term at relatively low interest rates and reap long-run benefits.', ""India does present a unique set of opportunities and challenges for global investors and businesses.

According to The Economic Survey 2017-18 the Indian economys fiscal balances, high savings rate, and trade openness require a nudge to move away from quixotic ideals to a more strategic plan that will help growth. Improvements in automation, education, innovation, healthcare, the role of women, government capability, and legal framework will provide a strong foundation for growth. If India follows the global best practices, how can the Government maintain the momentum to accelerate growth? What is the strategy required in the next few years and beyond in the face of growing protectionist sentiments. How will India negotiate the challenges in its quest for a double-digit growth?Frost & Sullivans Public Sector Practice tracks the developments on all facets of the Public Sector and our assessment and analysis addresses these futuristic queries. To know more about the Government Accelerator Program and other similar projects by Frost & Sullivans Public Sector Practice, please write to Priya George atpriyag@frost.com.Frost & Sullivan believes an initiative like the UAEsGovernment Accelerator Programwill fast-track the implementation of projects, policies, and regulations, and instill the culture of entrepreneurship and innovation in the Government, as well as encourage integration between government entities and private sector. The accelerator program strives to enhance competitiveness and diversify knowledge and innovation base of the economy.Talking about the Government Accelerator ProgramMani James, Vice President, Public Sector Practice, Frost & Sullivan said, Industry accelerators are catalysts that help to up the momentum of a countrys growth trajectory in short periods of time. We at Frost & Sullivan have provided and implemented transformational growth strategies across the globe. India is at that stage of development where ambitious growth plans require a roadmap for action, on similar lines as the accelerator program of the UAE, to target industry-specific challenges that will be addressed by these accelerators.Moving away from an oil export dependent economy, the UAE is on the path to diversify its sources of income through innovation and industrial expansion. Frost & Sullivan along with the UAE Government body established the first ever Government Industrial Accelerator Program in the Emirates. As theStrategic Consulting Partner, Frost & Sullivans implementation roadmap included a national program to develop innovative industry accelerators that will act as catalysts for business. For example, a single window for all seven Emirates is expected to ease starting a business in the Emirates. Starting a business in the UAE is a long process with each Emirate governed by its own protocols and documentations. This proposed solution was arrived at after a complex matrix of accelerators and sub accelerators were defined, filtered, and provided weightage. The Governments desire to support the industry through these accelerators is expected to solve various challenges faced by industries in the Emirates in a short period of time. For example, reducing the number of procedures, forms and providing a completely online process will improve/simplify the system of starting a business in the UAE. This accelerator program is in line with UAEs Vision 2021 objectives to improve the overall ease of doing business in the UAE.Parameters for the UAE industrial accelerator program were developed based on World Banks Ease of Doing Business ranking, benchmarking, surveys, workshops, and face-to-face interviews. Frost & Sullivan then proceeded to design five key industry accelerators with a roadmap for action that can enable acceleration, leverage existing studies, and confirm what is feasible with all key stakeholders. The implementation roadmap includes:Operating model for the accelerators working processesMonitoring and control mechanismsIdentifying government agencies and private sector entities that are considered partners in achieving the objectives of the accelerator program.The program accelerators for business aim at improving legislation efficiency, innovation efficiency, registration procedure efficiency, registration time efficiency, and cost efficiency. Frost & Sullivan believes a similar program for India will provide measurable and actionable solutions to accelerate growth and also improve Indias ranking in global indices such as World Banks Ease of Doing Business and INSEADs Global Competitiveness.About Frost & SullivanFrost & Sullivan, the Growth Partnership Company, works in collaboration with clients to leverage visionary innovation that addresses the global challenges and related growth opportunities that will make or break today's market participants.

The investment will be made for two purposes  (i) for enhancing flexible packaging capacity and (ii) for setting up solar power project for in-house power generation.The investment towards manufacturing capacity enhancement will be for procuring machinery and capital equipment such as flexo printing machines, different types of lamination machines, inspection machines, rewinding machines and utilities such as boilers, heating systems, chillers, generators, etc. The total capital commitment for this project will be Rs500cr in a phased manner, on 75 acres of land and will employ 500 people.Secondly, the company plans to invest Rs1,200cr on a solar project for captive power consumption. This is expected to result in power cost savings. The project will be on 300 acres of land and will employ 250 people.Our TakeAs on September 30, 2017, Uflex had consolidated D/E ratio of 0.45x and cash and liquid investments of Rs325cr on its books. Hence, it is clear that the current capex of Rs1,700cr would require the company to raise some debt. Given the comfortable D/E position, this should not be difficult. Setting up of solar power project will help reduce power and fuel costs for the company, which were 4.9% of consolidated revenues in Q3FY18. Hence, we view the investment announcement positively.Uflex is involved in manufacturing of end-to-end flexible packaging solutions. The company has a capacity of 3,37,000TPA and 1,00,000TPA for packaging films and packaging products respectively. The products of the company are BOPET films, BOPP films, CPP films, flexible packages, holograms, etc. Domestic plants are located in Noida, Jammu and Sanand, while overseas plants are located in Egypt, Poland, USA and Mexico.Q3FY18 results of Uflex showed some effect of high input costs, leading to 242bps yoy drop in EBITDA margins. Volume growth was healthy at 18.5% yoy for packaging segment and 11% yoy for polymeric films segment. Interest (up 20% yoy) and depreciation (up 16% yoy) expenses were elevated due to costs related to commissioning of aseptic liquid packaging material manufacturing plant at Sanand (Gujarat). This plant has annual production capacity of 7bn packs / cartons. Uflex expects to reach 60% capacity utilization in Sanand in FY19 and 80% in subsequent years, post which it may go in for further capacity expansion.Uflex Ltd is currently trading at Rs374 down by Rs0.65 or 0.17% from its previous closing of Rs374.65 on the BSE.The scrip opened at Rs375.75 and has touched a high and low of Rs376.65 and Rs370 respectively.

So far private players have only been allowed to operate mines for captive consumption. This move would end the monopoly of government-run Coal India that currently accounts for 84% of the nations coal production.This announcement probably has a lot to do withCoal India Ltd (CIL) missing its production target for 9MFY18. Production for the period stood at 383.9 mn tonnes, which is 94% of the production target for the period. This missing of production targets has had an impact on thermal plants across the country with coal stocks at 46 thermal plants at critical levels of less than 7 days of supply. Given that share of thermal power generation stood ~78% of total power generated for 9MFY18, the coal shortage has implications for the scope of expanding power generation in the country.Under the new auctions, the government will hold forward auctions in a similar process used for auction of captive coal blocks. However, under the new rules there will be no restriction on end-use or pricing. The coal ministry is currently in the process of shortlisting mines that would be available for auction.CIL is unlikely to face any impact in its operational and financial performance over the medium term over this development. Any new mines that are won in auction would require approximately three years to be operational giving CIL a chance to improve its operational performance before private participants begin production. It will be crucial to see how CIL addresses the issues pertaining to bloated labour levels (35.7% of revenues in FY17) and improving production efficiency.CIL holds a dominant market share in coal mining and produces 84% of the nations coal output. The production for the company stood at 543mn tonnes in FY17 against a target of 599mn tonnes (91% of target). The YTD offtake for CIL stands at 383.9mn tonnes against a production target of 406.6mn tonnes. The production target for FY18 stands at 630mn tonnes, an increase of 5% over last years target. The Working Group on Coal and Lignite has stated that they plan to expand production of CIL to 908mn tonnes by FY20.We expect the company to report revenue CAGR of 6.9% over FY17-20E aided by (a) ~6% CAGR volume in steel production over FY17-21E, (b) ~5% CAGR volume growth in thermal power generation over FY17-20E.

But even with that disappointment, those that participated did so with gusto  there were plenty of launches while multiple concepts were unveiled. EVs are coming due to the governments push, and it was evident in the way large manufacturers and start-ups showcased their products and prowess. Maruti continues to look a winner, Tata Motors and Honda cars are making a comeback, while TVS and UM are the ones to watch out for.","[""The layout was there, the manufacturers were there, the crowds were there, the flashbulbs went off at regular intervals like fireflies, the buzz was there in terms of decibel levels, and there was a lot of song and dance around launches and unveilings. But something was definitely missing at the 2018 Auto Expo. Asias largest Auto Show in its 14thedition somehow had its sheen taken off with many manufacturers giving MoTowns biennial event a miss. While the vast expanse was there from the 2016 event (well, almost  if you discount the yawning gaps at some places), there was a sense that either the RoI generated from the event was not working out to the benefit of manufacturers or that they didnt have products on offer/display to showcase at such a high-profile event or that they preferred to do the launches away from the event.Big names go missingThe number of participants dropped to 53 this year as against 59 in 2016. Those missing from the event included Jaguar-Land Rover (despite Tata Motors being there in a big way), Volvo cars, Volvo/Eicher buses/trucks, VolksWagen Group (VW, Skoda, Audi, Porsche, Lamborghini, Bentley, Ducati, Sacania, MAN), Fiat-Chrysler, Ford, Nissan, Datsun, Isuzu, Force Motors, Bharat Benz, Royal Enfield, Bajaj Auto, KTM, Harley-Davidson, Triumph, besides luxury brands like Ferrari and others. While Volvo Cars has been missing for a long time, Bajaj Auto (plus KTM) and Royal Enfield gave the biennial event a miss even in 2016. The two 2-wheeler giants generally try and do some ambush event/launch/marketing in and around the Auto Expo, but even they failed to deliver on that front this time around.Auto Expo 2018Image Source:Murali IyerThe VW Group had said that it didn't participate as the high cost associated with participating at this event was a deterrent. While they have promised to be back at the 2020 Auto Expo, it is common knowledge that with the Indian operations bleeding, a budget of Rs40-60 crore is seen as a stiff one. Even those that are expected to kick off operations in India like Peugeot and SAIC were missing, although Kia Motors made a huge splash (their Anantapur facility is expected to go on stream in 2019), and Kawasaki made a relatively quiet entry. Surprisingly, companies like Cummins, and large cycle brands were present at the Expo. I am sure automotive enthusiasts would have missed the 2-wheeled beauties that bear the Harley, Triumph, or Indian marquees, and also those from Audi and JLR. In my interactions with the top management of Honda cars, they were not too stressed about the costs, but more about the high decibel levels during the interaction! In fact they were happy that due to lesser participation, their big bang launches have got a lot more attention.EVs  momentum picking upBe that as it may, those that did participate are betting on the Indian consumer and also on Make in India, but there are concerns on the governments proposal to bulldoze the full EV environment by 2030. Manufacturers cite the lack of infrastructure and government support at various levels for this deadline to be tenable, and insist that maybe hybrids are a more viable option presently. Although they do cite instances of the government toning down posturing and rhetoric (in recent times, there have been comments that definitely point towards some thaw on that front!), it is not as if the EV momentum isn't picking up. Thanks to the government's push towards EVs and green mobility solutions, there were nearly 30 EV options on display across segments. While some were market-ready, some were in between, and some were in the concept stage. Come to think of it, a lot many start-ups were around with their concepts as one of the premise of this coming EV wave is that given the paradigm shift that will take place as the electric motor and batteries replace the internal combustible engine and fossil fuels, the leaders of today may not necessarily be the leaders of the future  they make be extinct too!The mood was more conceptual even at the pavilions of Mahindra and Tata Motors (who have already supplied EVs to the government via tender bids under EESL, and who had ready-to-launch EV models on display), although they seem to have the wherewithal to accelerate the production process. They are waiting for more clarity on the road ahead, including on issues like taxation, infrastructure, subsidy, etc. Ditto for Honda cars  while they have their reservations in the manner that the Indian government has been pushing this vexed issue of EVs, they say that they are preparing for the eventuality. They had showcased a couple of EV concepts and also had the Accord Hybrid and Clarity Fuel Cell cars on display. They feel that hybrids are the best way to go about this process. There were more soon-to-be-launched EV options in the 2- and 3-wheeler space (alongside concepts), and even a production-ready bike from TVS that would ride on ethanol as fuel  it will be exported to Brazil in 2018, but the moment India is ready for ethanol bikes, TVS would be there!Orange  flavor of the season!Orange seemed to be the flavour of the season at the Auto Expo  not the fruit, but the colour of choice for the concepts on display. Maruti Suzuki with the Future S, Mahindra with the TUV Stinger and KUV Xtreme, Kia SP (given such an unimaginative name, they ran a campaign asking visitors to suggest a name and the winner to get a prize!), and Tata Motors with the H5X were all coloured a bright orange...rang de tu mujhko gerua!Concepts ranged from the drool-worthy and futuristic (Renault Treazor) to sexy (DC TCA  a mid-engined supercar that takes inspiration from La Ferrari and Pagani Zonda) to beautiful (Tata 45X) to macho (TVS Zeppelin) to powerful (Emflux One electric superbike) to suave (Mercedes EQ) to muscular (Mahindra TUV Stinger) to purposeful (Tata H5X) to dreamy (Uniti) to cutting edge (TaMo RaceMo) to outlandishly attractive (Maruti Suzuki Future-S) to strictly okay-ish (Hyundai Kona) to cute (Honda NeuV) to somewhat ugly (Maruti Suzuki e-Survivor) to average (Kia SP). Many concepts get showcased just to show the design language or thoughts of the future from manufacturers. But a lot of the concepts showcased at the current Auto Expo were pretty close to production. Their eventual launch date (and also the final shape and form, besides the configuration, etc) will depend on consumer feedback, government action, company policy, et al.Car launches  Honda makes stirring comebackThere were launches galore on four wheels from Maruti (new Swift), Mahindra (XUV700 or Rexton), Tata Motors (Nexon AMT, Tiago/Tigor JTP in cars, and Intra/Ultra in CVs), Honda (new Amaze, Civic, new CR-V), Toyota (Yaris, Alphard), Mercedes (E220d All-Terrain or Estate, Maybach S650), BMW (6-series GT, M5, M3 sedan/M4 coupe, X6, i8 Roadster, i3s, new X3), and Mini (Countryman, Clubman, Cooper S). Toyota garnered a lot of attention on the Yaris launch  this will compete against the Honda City, Maruti Ciaz, and Hyundai Verna. They also showcased the Alphard  a luxurious people mover.But it was Honda Cars that kicked up a storm and made a stirring comeback. They created a huge buzz with three launches  all-new Amaze (looks like a mini City), new CR-V (including the diesel variant), and the return of Civic (sharp design, notchback) after a hiatus of three years. All these should be launched in India in fiscal 2018-19. They have another three launches over the next three years, one of which would be the compact SUV crossover, HR-V. This will be based on the Brio/Amaze platform and compete against the Hyundai Creta, and also Kia's SP as and when that will launch.Maruti  still a strong BUYWith a covered area of more than 4000 sq. metre, Maruti had one of the biggest pavilions. As in 2014 and 2016, this time around too Maruti took the lead in the first unveiling of the event  the ultra-compact SUV concept Future-S. This will be the design language of the future SUVs from Maruti. While nothing was revealed about its eventual launch, etc, we think that this would be the vehicle that will eventually replace the entry-level Alto in Marutis line-up and will be positioned against the Renault Kwid. Besides this, they had also displayed a Hybrid system, which is being pushed as an alternative to the full EV by 2030 proposed by the government. The Hybrid system on display was a proper hybrid like that used by Toyota (EV partner to Maruti in India) in Prius and Camry, and it powers Solio and Swift models that are manufactured and sold in Japan. Maruti announced that the first full EV from their stables would be launched in 2020. Two concepts and the all-new Swift (whose images had already been released earlier) were showcased by Maruti. But other cars from their portfolio like Ciaz and Ertiga refreshes, new WagonR, and the much-speculated-upon 7-seater version of WagonR were all missing from the pavilion.But, Maruti should enjoy at least two years of unfettered run. This is definitely good news for shareholders.Hyundai  steadyWe expected to see the re-launch of the Santro from Hyundai. While it wasnt there, the launch seems to be sometime in 2018, but Hyundai says that the name hasn't been finalised as yet. Given the high brand recall for the Santro in India, that is as good a brand name as any to go with. There was a lot of speculation around the Kona Iron Man concept  whether it would be launched below the Creta as a SUV or as a new premium hatch format. Hyundai clearly stated that the Kona was just a display and nothing more should be read into it. But given that the Kona has been on sale in global markets since June 2017, I was surprised to see only the concept, and not the actual vehicle. Something tells me that Hyundai is definitely gauging market reaction to the concept to see if it can be introduced in India or not. Hyundai also showcased the Ioniq twins  a full electric one and a hybrid. Depending on the market conditions and feedback, Hyundai is ready to introduce them here. Hyundai doesnt want to get on the AMT bandwagon, but will surely not miss out on the EV/hybrid revolution.Mahindra  betting on RextonOther disappointments (besides the Maruti ones) were the no-show from Mahindra on the U321 MPV, which is supposed to sit between the Maruti Ertiga and the Toyota Innova. Now, news is filtering out that the launch has been pushed back by at least six months. The Ssangyong Tivoli showcased at the 2016 Auto Expo was missing, but what was unveiled was the new Ssangyong Rexton G4 in Mahindra badging. A full 7-seater SUV, it will go against the Ford Endeavour and Toyota Fortuner. Whether it would be called Mahindra XUV 700 or Mahindra Rexton is still to be decided. Given the features, expect a pricing closer to Rs25 lakh, but with the features that it comes with, the 7-seater will be tough competition to the aforementioned duo. There were multiple concepts on display, including a macho piece on the KUV and a wonderful render of the Thar  Wanderlust.Tata Motors  upping the ante!Tata Motors left me positively drooling given the concepts that they unveiled. Despite owning Pininfarina, Mahindra's design team would be left scratching their heads on why their team was unable to come out with the kind of concepts that Tata Motors was able to showcase. Suffice to say that the design team at Tata Motors is doing some real amazing work, and nowhere was it better highlighted than in the gorgeous near-production-ready H5X concept (expected in early 2019). The 45X concept is still some time away (late 2019/early 2020), and that will be pitted against the premium hatches available in the market today  Maruti Baleno, Hyundai i20 Elite. I expect H5X to retain nearly most of the design characteristics from the prototype that was showcased  this has been built on the Land Rover L8 platform, which is used by the LR Discovery Sport. The smaller version will borrow the 2.0-litre turbocharged oil burner from the Jeep Compass, but in a lower state of tune. I expect it to roll out from the same production facility at Ranjangaon (near Pune) that is used for the Compass.The H5X 5-seater variant will go up against Hyundai Creta and Renault Duster, and is expected to be a little premium in features, but competitive in pricing. The 7-seater variant will be more powerful (possibly 180-190 bhp), and will get pitted against Mahindra Rexton/XUV 700, Toyota Fortuner, and Ford Endeavour. And then besides the AMT variant of the Nexon, the other highlights were the JTP cousins of Tiago and Tigor. The Tiago JTP and Tigor JTP are the performance variants of these cars in partnership with Jayem Auto, and should hit the markets within the next six months. Both are powered by a 1.2-litre turbocharged petrol engine that unleashes 108 horses. It comes with a few cosmetic and real changes on the outside (twin exhausts, air dam on the bonnet), wider tyres, retuned suspension, racing trim, aluminium pedals, and lower riding heights.Besides these and a few unveilings in the LCV/MHCV space (Intra/Ultra), the highlights from Tata Motors were the EVs on Tiago/Tigor  production-ready but waiting for clarity. Similarly, the RaceMo 2-seater sports car in petrol and electric variants looks gorgeous with butterfly wing doors, and I would be keen to see Tata unleash them at the Indian customer, even if it is in limited numbers  bring it on, I say! I would be a glad buyer. Besides the disappointment of not seeing the JLR line-up of RR Velar, E-Pace, and I-Pace, another disappointment was not seeing some sharp image makeover for the good ol Nano. But on the whole, way to go Tata Motors.Kia Motors  showcasing their rangeWith a lot of the big guns missing, and a dull show by Hyundai (for the second event running) and Mahindra cutting down on its pavilion size, the big buzz was actually provided by Kia. Cars will be shipped out in 2019 from their upcoming Anantapur facility in Andhra Pradesh (an investment of US$1.1 bn for a 300,000 unit plant). They had the global unveiling of the SP Concept (compact SUV that looks deceptively similar to the Creta), and this would be their first launch in India. The launch of this will coincide or be pretty close to the intended launch of the Honda HR-V, which should be a very good space to watch. Kia also showcased a smorgasbord of 15 models that included compact hatches, premium hatches, sedans, sports cars, SUVs, MPVs, and green cars. The showcasing of so many models was to introduce India to the Kia brand and its range. Besides the SP Concept, Kia plans to introduce a premium hatch and a smaller SUV to rival the Brezza. While Maruti will be keeping an eye on Kias moves, the threat is some time away, and it is not as if Maruti hasnt fended off competition from Hyundai and others all these years.2-wheelers  plenty of launchesIn the 2-wheeler space, there is a lot of action shaping up  both in scooters and motorcycles. The scooter segment saw high launch intensity. Given the interest in long distance biking in India, a slew of existing and new entrants were seen showcasing their motorbikes. The big launches were from BMW Motorad (betting big on India with a string of launches); Kawasaki with premium bikes (one of them was the Ninja superbike: 998cc, inline 4, supercharged petrol engine that develops 197 bhp @ 11000 rpm and 137.3 Nm of torque @ 9500 rpm priced at Rs25 lakh  yes, you read all of that right!); TVS Motor with two concepts (electric scooter Creon, electric bike Zeppelin), ethanol bike Apache RTR 200 Fi, and the Apache RR310 (sharing its underpinnings with BMW G310R  showcased at the 2016 Auto Expo as a concept and launched in December 2017); and UM Motorcycles with three bikes, including an electric cruiser. Hero Moto did up the ante with its range of scooters and premium bikes, but was relatively quiet despite the launches and despite the size of their pavilion, others like Yamaha, Suzuki, Honda, and Piaggio (Vespa, Aprilia, Moto Guzzi) were fairly buzzing. So were smaller launches from Emflux (a homegrown electric superbike priced at Rs6.5-7 lakh  deliveries start in the second half of 2018), Twenty Two Motors, Cleveland CycleWerks, Okinawa, etc.UMs range  competition for Royal EnfieldUM (a JV between Lohia Motors and United Motors of the US) kicked off operations in India in 2015-2016, and had unveiled a direct competition to the Royal Enfield at the last Expo. Given the growing success of the UM Renegade Commando and UM Renegade Commando Mojave, UM Motorcyclestook the wraps off three new motorcycles at the 2018 Auto Expo. The cynosure of attraction was the UM Renegade Thor, which is the worlds first electric cruiser bike. Prices start at Rs4.9 lakh (a CBU import from Italy), but the bike will be launched in India only in 2020! The other bikes unveiled were the Renegade Duty S and the Renegade Duty Ace. Both of them are urban cruisers with a 223cc single cylinder engine, which outputs 17 bhp @ 8000 rpm and 17 Nm of peak torque @ 5000 rpm. Priced at Rs1.1 lakh and with deliveries starting this year, UM expects to garner volumes from the growing craze for long distance biking.I maintain that this is the real competition to the Royal Enfield brand, and to that extent the Eicher Motors stock should give away some of its exalted valuations.Electric buses  getting charged for the futureJBM Auto launched their 100% electric bus in a JV with Solaris  the JV will be investing Rs300 crore into the Indian market. Besides them, electric buses were also launched by Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland with Sun Mobility of Chetan Maini (the original poster boy of electric cars in India with his start-up), and Mahindra (still in the concept stage in the sense that there is a long way to go for the actual launch), besides BYD of China in a JV with Goldstone Tech. The Indo-Chinese JV has got an order for eight of these buses from BEST for public transportation in Mumbai, and they have already been initiated into the BEST fleet in recent times. All of these manufacturers are working on superfast charging stations and ports, and also other methods including swappable batteries.Auto industry  at crossroadsThat the auto industry is at a crossroad is there for all to see. This has been due to the confusion and nervousness around policy decisions and disruptions (Euro VI emission norms, the sudden deadline and push towards full EVs by 2030, etc). Such a situation also brings about a lot of uncertainty, and that is probably another key reason for the dispirited display at Indian MoTowns biennial showpiece event. Add to it the high cost of holding such an event, and the resultant return not being up to the mark for many. And then like the utter domination of certain names in Formula One from the late 90s to now, the Indian market is also seeing Maruti dominate like never before. Between Maruti, Hyundai, and Mahindra, the trio control 70% of the market, and the rest are finding the road tough to navigate. And these policy decisions or sudden aggression from the government is amplifying the problem.There is friction on many counts and at many levels. As the push for EVs goes up (even though the government seems to be backtracking on their earlier aggression given the real multiple constraints), there has been a push towards using hybrids, something a few players already have a head start on. There is now an active hybrid lobby led by Toyota and many EV makers have formed a new lobby group called the Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles (SMEV).\xa0These new groups mean that there is a lot of turbulence within the industry, and the pulls and pressures are working in different directions. This will only weaken MoTowns voice, unless better sense prevails quickly.Maybe this is the reason why even among the manufacturers that participated, a few seemed jaded. While overall enthusiasm from visitors was palpable, and global and Indian media was present in full force, I believe that SIAM will have to relook at this event and see what needs to be done to get more manufacturers to participate at the 2020 Auto Expo. If they dont pull up their socks, the so-called Asias premier automotive show will soon have to relinquish the honours in favour of the automotive jamborees at Shanghai, Beijing, Tokyo, or maybe soon at Bangkok!Figure 1:Upcoming PV launches by segmentLaunch timeOEMModel nameCommentsHatchback  48% of PV market4QFY18MarutiSwiftAll new Swift (3rd generation)4QFY18HyundaiElite i20Mid-life refresh; vs. Baleno, JazzCompact sedan (CS)  13% of PV market1HFY19HondaAmazeAll new Amaze; vs. Dzire, Tigor, XcentMid-size & premium sedan  6% of PV market1QFY19ToyotaYarisvs. Honda City, Maruti Ciaz, Hyundai VernaCY19HondaCivicAll new Civic; above Honda CityUVs\xa0  27% of PV marketH2CY19KiaSP ConceptMade for India SUV, first launch from KiaTata MotorsH5XSUV based on Land Rover platformHyundaiKonaCompact SUV; likely below CretaM&MRextonLarge SUV under Mahindra brandM&MMPVNot showcased, to be launched in FY19Source: IIFL ResearchFigure 2:Electric and green vehicles announced/showcasedOEMModel nameCommentsCarsTataTigor EV130km range, max speed 100kmph, 216Ah, 72V battery, Normal/Quick charging time (up to 80%) of 360/90 minsTataTiago EVM&MeKUV100on e-Verito EV module; 110km range, max speed of 86kmphM&MAtom & UdoHyundaiIoniq280km range, Quick charging time 23 minsRenaultZoe400km range, 41 kWh battery2WsTVSCreon80km range, 3 Li-ion battery - 12kW, Expected launch CY20TVSApache EthanolNot electric, max speed 129kmph, Brazil market launch in CY18HondaPCXFull electric concept modelSource: IIFL ResearchFigure 3: Upcoming 2W launches by segmentSegmentsOEMModel nameCommentsMotorcycles  62% of 2W market1QFY19HeroXtreme 200200cc motorcycle; vs. Pulsars and Apaches1QFY19HeroXpulse 200200cc; in niche adventure touring segment4QFY18HondaXBlade 160vs. Apache 160, Pulsar 150/1804QFY18YamahaR15155cc sports bike; 3rd generationNot knownTVSZeppelin220cc; effective power of 300cc with e-motorScooters  34% of 2W market1QFY19HeroMaestro 125125cc version of existing 110cc scooters; pitted against Activa 125, Access 1251QFY19HeroDuet 1254QFY18TVSNtorq 125Sporty 125cc; vs. Honda Grazia, Activa 1251HFY19TVSHybrid scooterNot showcased; launch in next 4-6 months4QFY18HondaActiva 5GMinor Refresh1QFY19SuzukiBurgman Street125cc sporty-looking scooter; vs. Grazia4QFY18PiaggioAprilla SR125125cc scooter2HCY18PiaggioStorm 125125cc scooterSource: IIFL Research""]"

Given its current run rate, Coal India is also likely to miss its production target for FY18 as well.This move will benefit thermal power producers by improving the availability of coal within the country. The number of thermal power plants, where stock levels are either critical or super-critical reached at 21 last week, up from 20 in the previous week. This is in spite of coal stocks rising 14.4% mom to 13.4mn metric tonnes.CIL holds a dominant market share in coal mining and produces 84% of the nations coal output. The production for the company stood at 543mn tonnes in FY17 against a target of 599mn tonnes (91% of target). The YTD offtake for CIL stands at 383.9mn tonnes against a production target of 406.6mn tonnes. The production target for FY18 stands at 630mn tonnes, an increase of 5% over last years target. The Working Group on Coal and Lignite has stated that they plan to expand production of CIL to 908mn tonnes by FY20.We expect the company to report revenue CAGR of 6.9% over FY17-20E aided by (a) ~6% CAGR volume in steel production over FY17-21E, (b) ~5% CAGR volume growth in thermal power generation over FY17-20E.

Enabling provisions have been made in the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015 for allocation of coal mines by way of auction and allotment for the sale of coal.The methodology gives highest priority to transparency, ease of doing business and ensures that natural resources are used for national development. The auction will be an ascending forward auction whereby the bid parameter will be the price offer in Rs per tonne which will be paid to the State Government on the actual production of coal. There shall be no restriction on the sale and/or utilization of coal from the coal mine.This reform is expected to bring efficiency into the coal sector by moving from an era of monopoly to competition. It will increase competitiveness and allow the use of best possible technology into the sector. The higher investment will create direct and indirect employment in coal bearing areas especially in mining sector and will have an impact on economic development of these regions.It will also lead to energy security as 70% of Indias electricity is generated from thermal power plants. This reform will ensure assured coal supply, accountable allocation of coal and affordable coal leading to affordable power prices for consumers.As the entire revenue from the auction of coal mines for sale of coal would accrue to the coal bearing States, this methodology shall incentivize them with increased revenues which can be utilized for the growth and development of backward areas and their inhabitants including tribal.

On February 14, 2018, PNB announced to the Indian stock exchange that the bank had discovered some fraudulent and unauthorized transactions amounting to Rs113.9 billion ($1.8 billion).The fraudulent transactions represent a contingent liability and the financial impact will be determined by the relevant law in India (Baa2 stable). Nevertheless, Moody's expects that PNB will need to provide for at least a substantial portion of the exposure. As a result, the bank's profitability will likely come under pressure, although the actual impact will depend on the timing and quantum of provisions that need to be made, as well as any prospects for recovery.The fraudulent transactions represent about 230 basis points of the bank's risk-weighted assets as of December 31, 2017. As such, PNB's capital position would deteriorate markedly, and fall below minimum regulatory requirements, if the bank is required to provide for the entire exposure. Consequently, PNB may need to raise capital externally mainly from the government to comply with the minimum Basel III capital requirement of an 8% common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio by March 31, 2019.The bank reported a CET1 ratio of 8.05% in the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Since the announcement of the fraudulent exposure, PNB's share price has fallen by about 30% as of the end of February 19, 2018, limiting the bank's access to the equity capital markets.The discovery of the fraudulent transactions also highlights the weak operational controls and corporate governance at the bank. The fraudulent letters of undertaking for raising buyers credit had been transmitted via the SWIFT channels without obtaining the approval of the competent authority or necessary legal documentation, and were not entered into the bank's core banking system.The review for downgrade will focus on:\xa0 the timing and quantum of the financial impact of the fraudulent transactions, any management actions taken to improve the capitalization profile of the bank, and any punitive actions taken by the regulator on the bank.Moody's assumes a very high probability of government support for PNB in times of need, resulting in a three-notch uplift to its deposit and issuer ratings from its BCA. In the review for downgrade, Moody's will also assess government support for the bank's deposits and senior unsecured debt.""]"

However, the reality is that this process usually happens at the fag end of an industry downturn and actually helps in catalyzing a much stronger come-back.The real estate sector is a clear case in point. It is emerging from a prolonged slowdown coupled with landmark policy inputs which have begun to edge out the 'small fry' - essentially creating an environment of large-scale consolidation of tier II and III developers. This dynamic alone will define 2018 as a year of massive positive change for Indian real estate.In 2017, the overall Indian economy and the real estate sector, in particular, were well and truly shaken up by a series of unprecedented reforms and structural changes. Without a doubt, demonetization, RERA and GST will go down in the annals of Indian real estate history as the 'trishul' that struck at the very heart of unregulated real estate players and practices.Understandably, they resulted in panic among many of the smaller players. If we take just the case of RERA, it becomes evident why this was the case. RERA enforces financial discipline, transparency, accountability, customer centricity and compliance, and these were either completely alien concepts or at least completely avoidable philosophies for the smaller (and often dubious) developers active on the market then.While DeMon blew the lid off the top of the cauldron of black money in the sector, only a handful of the players in the Indian real estate industry will be able to ride the tide in the post-RERA/GST Era - for the following reasons:Rising costs and complexityRERA and GST necessitate a radical change in the methods of doing real estate business. There is a massive focus on compliance, documentation, processes, etc. which will increase the costs and complexity of business operations. In addition, developers will have to invest significantly in upgrading their billing systems, CRM, etc. as well as training their vendors, contractors and other stakeholders to ensure 100% compliance to RERA and GST norms.There are, of course, smaller developers who while not necessarily national players are still very strong in their own local markets. However, most of the smaller players are fringe operators who do not have the financial muscle to update their systems and abide by all the new norms. Most of these players will either look at exiting the business altogether or tag along with large, organized developers.Liquidity crunchUnder the RERA regime, pre-launches have come to a complete halt. In addition, developers have to mandatorily park 70% of the funds received from buyers into any particular project in a separate escrow account, to be used only for construction expenses involving that particular project. The eradication of the entire mechanism of rolling funds has utterly shaken up the hitherto existing status quo on the Indian real estate market.Simultaneously, the crackdown on black money has closed all illegal means of raising funds, even as PE players interested in Indian housing plays are now doing extremely scrupulous due diligence and investing only in clean projects. It is a nigh-impossible market environment for the under-equipped player to raise fresh funds. Smaller developers, especially tier II and tier III developers, will face the brunt of these norms, resulting in a liquidity crisis which will necessitate their exit from the business.The existing burden of stalled projectsIn the pre-RERA regime, there was no particular law to ensure that the developers complete projects as per commitments. They had more than sufficient scope for endlessly deferring completion by stating reasons such as approval delays, change in norms, etc. In reality, capital collected from their customers was 'rolled' to purchase new land or construct other projects. As a result of such dubious processes and false promises, many homebuyers were duped and as per estimates, there are around 57,000 units in 170 stalled projects across the top 7 cities of India.With the exceptionally strict compliance norms under RERA, the task of completing their stalled projects is going to be exceptionally daunting for many tier II and tier III developers who have very little inherent financial muscle. These projects will inevitably be sold on an as-is basis to large developers and/or converted into other assets such as plotted developments. In any case, large-scale consolidation of assets is on the cards.Debt repayment pressureWith subdued real estate demand for the past few years, many developers have leveraged their balance sheets to an extent that has made it impossible for them to manage their debt repayment schedules. With some developers already declaring bankruptcy, banks and FIs are also keeping a close watch on the repayments and are completely unwilling to take any adventurous risks. With massive pressure to repay their existing debt, many tier II and tier III developers are likely to declare bankruptcy in the near future - again, pushing the cause of large-scale consolidation.To summarize...Demonetization, RERA and GST will surely create a more robust market environment, but the short-term pain is symptomatic of a terminal condition for a very significant number of smaller players. The previous dynamics that defined the Indian real estate industry - opacity, financial indiscipline, inadequate redressal mechanism and false commitments - are not the only things that are on their way out. Massive consolidation, tantamount to a one-time clean-up before the sector embarks on a journey of healthier growth, is very much on the agenda over the next couple of years.Anuj Puri, Chairman, ANAROCK Property Consultants""]"

If this acquisition is successful it would increase the domestic steel capacity of Tata Steel by ~43% to 18.6mn tonnes per annum. The strong rise in domestic steel consumption would support the inorganic expansion by Tata Steel and the stock is likely to trade with a positive bias.Bhushan Steel Ltd is among the 12 large corporate accounts identified by the RBI that accounted for ~25% of the exposure to bad loans for the banking sector. Bhushan Steel has an outstanding debt of Rs50,000cr, with bank dues standing at ~Rs44,000cr. Bhushan Steel is a producer of cold-rolled steel products\xa0 with a steelmaking capacity of 5.6mn tonnes per annum.TSL is an international steel company with a manufacturing presence in Europe and Asia. The domestic operations of TSL are protected against increase in raw material prices due to backward integration. The total steel capacity of the company stood at 27.5 mtpa as on FY17. The company is planning to upgrade the capacity of the Kalinganagar plant from 3 to 8 mtpa. This would take the domestic steel capacity of TSL to ~18mtpa. The upcoming JV with Thyssen Krupp is expected to help revive the prospects for Tata Steel Europe through improved scale. The company has recently come up with a rights issue to raise up to Rs12,800cr through the issuance of up to 23.31cr shares. The proceeds of the rights issue would be used to lower the debt of the company.We expect the company to report revenue CAGR of 5.3% over FY17-20E aided by 6.1% volume growth in domestic steel production supported by spending on construction and infrastructure. EBITDA margins are also likely to expand by ~573bps owing to better utilization for Tata Steel India. The stock is currently trading at 7.7x FY20E EPS.""]"

Leading digital wallet companies have declared unprecedented usage and the industry looks set to grow into a $6 billion giant by 2020.","[""The concept of currency has come a long way, from barter to banknotes. Now paper currency finds itself being rapidly substituted by its digital form. E-Wallets have benefitted greatly from the demonetization drive, with even roadside vendors accepting e-wallet payments. Leading digital wallet companies have declared unprecedented usage and the industry looks set to grow into a $6 billion giant by 2020.DefinitionE-Wallet is an online money account which can make transactions without the need for a physical card. E-Wallets are similar to debit cards because they operate through pre-loaded money.An E-Wallet can be an electronic device or website that allows commercial transactions. It is a system that allows users to purchase items using near-field communications technology.The RBI classifies E-Wallets under Pre-paid payment instruments monitored under thePayment and Settlements Systems Act, 2005.Now that you have a basic idea of what they are. Here are 5 things you need to know about E-Wallets.1. Types of E-Wallets:The RBI has allowed for the following three kinds of E-Wallets: -Closed:These are issued by companies to their clients for buying goods and services. These wallets allow transactions only with that particular service provider.They do not allow you to withdraw cash, however.Semi-Closed:These are used to buy goods and services (including financial ones) at specified establishments. These merchant sites or establishments have contracts with the wallet issuer to accept payment from the wallet.These also do not allow you to withdraw cash.Open:Open wallets are similar to semi-closed wallets in that, they too allow the purchase of goods and services at sale terminals.However, these also allow cash withdrawal at ATM's or business locations.2. How to get an E-Wallet?You can avail of most E-Wallet services by following these simple steps: -Download the application onto your device:Most E-Wallets are mobile or desktop apps and can be easily downloaded onto your mobile, tablet or PC.Fill in the basic details:After app installation, you need to fill in some basic details. names, date of birth, email address, mobile number. Optional bank details or PAN card information may be required to be filled upSet up PIN/Password:The final step of registering yourself for an E-Wallet is to set up a PIN/password. A One-Time Password(OTP) is sent to your mail id or mobile number for validation and the process is doneLink Cards:In some E-Wallets, you need to link a debit card or such to start payments.3. How do they work?You pre-load the money into the E-Wallet for making transactions. Linked cards or bank accounts do this.However, the money you see in your wallet is just a digital representation. The actual money is stored in the service providers account held for you. The same is done for all users.When you transfer money to another wallet by the same service provider. The ledger for the accounts held for both parties is updated with the transaction amount.When you pay a third party, like on paying mobile bills, the wallet company makes the payment to the vendor.Banks will use IMPS to deal with your E-Wallet service provider.4. How are they made secure?Though some have raised concern about how secure E-Wallets are just as secure as cards, if not more.Tokenization to encrypt personal data, so its more difficult for hackers.Some providers have also started bringing in a biometric verification to ensure securitySome e-wallets also put in an option of deleting wallet data in case the phone is lost.Two-factor authentication via OTP is also a strong fraud.5. What are their advantages?It minimizes risk of theft as there is neither physical money nor cards to be stolenIt allows you to operate multiple accounts at the same timeReduces the cost of doing banking transactionsFaster and more streamlined user experience.Conclusion:E-Wallets have made digital payments easy and secure much to your benefit. Above mentioned information is helpful in understanding payments via E-Wallets, which also contributes to the cause of Digital India.""]"

In simpler terms, it is the average of values from the desired number of days.","['There once existed a time when trade was simply restricted to giving and taking of goods or services. Even though we still associate trading as giving and taking of tangible commodities, there have been too many branches that adorn this mighty tree. Shares, futures, and bonds are few of the many things that are traded in the current market. With increasing complexities, there has been an increase in various value computing and calculating methods. One such method is the calculating Moving Averages.Moving Average can be defined as a tool that provides a stable observation in the price action of shares. In simpler terms, it is the average of values from the desired number of days. One important detail about Moving Averages is that it relies on the data of activities that have already occurred in the past. Thus giving them the term, Lagging Indicators.The two widely used Moving Averages are the Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the Exponential Moving Average (EMA). While an SMA utilizes the basic averaging method, EMA shifts a greater preference to the recent value of shares.Moving Averages: Simple and EfficientWhen you plot a 50-day graph that indicates prices of shares during the duration, youd notice vague fluctuations. Moving Averages cancel it out by plotting a relatively smoother graph. While observing this graph, one must look out for what kind of a trend does the Moving Average follow. An Uptrend is a situation when Moving Averages act as support for the shares prices, which bounces off upwards. Similarly, a Downtrend is a situation when Moving Average acts as resistance to the share prices. It means share prices fall downwards, below the Moving Average. Naturally, an Uptrend Moving Average is the most preferred option.The time period employed in the reading of the market trends plays a very crucial role in determining the current momentum. The momentum is favourable when shorter Moving Averages (measured within a time period of 20 days) are located above the longer Moving Averages (measured with the time period of 100 days or more). The case is vice-versa when shorter Moving Averages fall below the longer Moving Averages.Investors while observing Moving Averages keep a keen eye on crossovers as well. Crossover is the point where the share value and Moving Average intersect. It is basically the point where a possible change in trend could take place. Here, two of the most interesting crossovers are the Golden Crossover and Death Crossover. Golden Crossover occurs when a shorter Moving Average moves above the longer Moving Average, triggering a buy signal. Death Crossover is a scenario when shorter Moving Average crosses below the longer Moving Average, which a sure sell sign.Summing It UpSimplification of data by Moving Averages eases the tedious process of differentiating trends. But, as is the case in everything, Moving Averages can sometimes cause false signals. This occurs especially in the case of an Exponential Moving Average that shifts its position quickly to any price change. All apart, the ability of an Moving Average to predict a possible support or resistance cannot be undermined. Its simplicity is its best tool.']"

When you opt for a personal loan, it is not secured against an asset like your home or your car, and hence it is also called as an unsecured loan.","[""When you are in need of cash, the bank allows you two options. You can choose a personal loan or use the overdraft facility. When you opt for a personal loan, it is not secured against an asset like your home or your car, and hence it is also called as an unsecured loan. If you choose the overdraft facility you can borrow money through your bank's current account. There is an upper limit to the money you can withdraw.But which is the best route, and which one is better in which situation? Read on to find out the differences between an overdraft account and a personal loan:Faster Funds Release and SimplicityIn the case of aPersonal Loan,you have to deal with a lot of paperwork. First off, you will need a decent CIBIL score to get your loan approved. Every time you need cash you will have to follow the same application process. Plus, you may get the money only after the loan is sanctioned.After you set up anOverdraftAccountyou can withdraw money within a couple of hours and/or definitely within one business day. You dont have to repeatedly set up an overdraft account every time you need money.FlexibilityPersonal loansdont leave much room for flexibility. You have to pay a fixed Equated Monthly Instalment (EMI) for the duration of the tenure and the payments also have to be timely. For many people, this could be a problem, especially for individuals who have a varying income every month.Personal Overdraftallows you to take as much money as you need within the limits set for you. You can spread out the repayment as per your convenience. You can pay within days, weeks, or months- whatever suits you.Interest CostsOnce you have taken aPersonal Loan, the interest starts to accumulate immediately, even if you are not using the money at all. If you prepay the loan amount, you will also have to pay prepayment fees along with the principal and interest amount due till that time.In the case ofOverdraft,you wouldnt have to pay interest on money you havent withdrawn from the overdraft limit. With an overdraft, there is no problem with prepaying the amount there wont be any additional charges for it.CIBIL Score ProtectionIf you regularly takePersonal loansand repay them, then your CIBIL score will fluctuate frequently. Events like cheque bounce can cause your score to drop, and if these are frequent, then you can also have a hard time obtaining loans or credit cards in the future.If you opt for anOverdraft Account,these hassles can be avoided. Under overdraft facility, you will have only one loan which you are regularly servicing. This might give a positive boost to your CIBIL Score.Summing UpOverdrafts are more viable when compared to personal loans. When there is a possibility where you might need multiple personal loans it is better to choose an overdraft account. However, if you are going for just one loan which has a larger principal amount and pay back over a longer term then you should consider a Personal loan.""]"

However, contrary to your belief and wishes, a good time to start is in your early 20s. This is because this is the time when you are most independent and have to take control of your finances.The Income Tax Department allows saving up to Rs1.5 lakh every year by investing in tax-saving avenues such as Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity-linked Savings Scheme (ELSS) or National Pension Scheme (NPS). It is wise to take advantage of such avenues and save on the taxes you pay yearly.You can maximise your tax saving and start your independent financial life on the right foot. If youre in your 20s, this is how you can save on tax and plan your financial year:Dont push it off till the last minuteIts best that you plan your financial year in the first quarter as you have the time to properly plan your tax-saving investments. Avoid making last minute decisions so as to not make bad investments. One should estimate the income and make a rough calculation about the money you will spend that year.Have a diverse tax saving portfolioOne can build a portfolio with a mix of debt and equity investments, which earns good returns without high amounts of risk. Equity-oriented investments have an element of risk whereas debt-oriented tax-saving investments offer guaranteed returns and capital protection.Invest in ELSS fundsFor long-term investments, ELSS funds can help get higher returns and also reduces the risk. Unlike investment like PPF and Fixed Deposits (FDs), ELSS funds can fetch you inflation-beating returns over the long term.Avail tax exempt expensesLife Insurance premium, Health Insurance premium, Loan repayments, etc. are eligible for tax exemption. These are payments that have already been made, so be sure to avail the tax exemption under Section 80C.Fulfil goals with tax saving investmentsTax-saving investments are for the long term and can help you reach your financial goals like saving for a car, a home, a vacation, etc.As a young investor, one can continue to invest in ELSS funds to reap the long-term benefits that they can offer, even through a bad market phase. Your 20s lay the foundation for a bright and strong financial future. Tax-saving investments and expenses can get you the both, saving money and also to ease your financial life.

Instead, the Minister said that there should be action plans that would lead to the fleet electrification. This is in sharp contrast to Mr. Gadkaris earlier target of having an all-electric fleet in India by CY2030. We feel that there are several reasons that would have compelled the Government to soften its stance.Reasons for change in stanceFirst, the huge investment needed for setting up charging stations across the country. The Government has already revised its fiscal deficit target upwards for FY18 (from 3.2% to 3.5% of GDP) and FY19 (from 3% to 3.3% of GDP). Hence, there is little fiscal space, at least in the near term, which would allow a pan-India investment in charging stations.Secondly, the decision to electrify its fleet has met with strong resistance from automakers who have stated that the given target (CY2030) would be too early to meet and would cause disruptions by way of technology and unemployment. As per a report by FICCI-NASSCOM and E&Y, the automobile sector provided direct employment to 12.8mn people in FY2017, expected to rise to 14.3mn by CY2022. The fallout of any disruptive changes in the sector would have serious implications on the employment situation in the country.FAME SchemeThe Government has allocated Rs394cr from April 2015 to March 2018 for its FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles) scheme. The automobile industry expected this scheme to continue beyond March 2018, however, the Finance Minister did not announce anything on FAME incentives in his Budget speech on February 1, 2018.Our TakeWe feel that the relaxation of Governments stance will come as a huge relief to all automakers and component makers. These companies have already showcased their EV readiness in the recent Auto Expo 2018 and even outside of it. We feel that they would get more time to get their technology and infrastructure in place, given that the haste would no longer be there. However, it is clear that EV adoption would be the way forward for the automobile sector. The move is expected to have a positive effect on the Auto Indices (S&P BSE Auto Index and NIFTY Auto Index) in todays trading session.']"

However, the bank did not specify the quatum of liabiltiy for the bank and if the alleged fraudulent LoUs were backed by cash margins.What is a Letter of Undertaking?A Letter of Undertaking (LoU) is an assurance given by one bank to another to meet a liability on behalf of a customer. LoUs are used in international banking transactions. An LoU is issued for overseas import remittances. This transaction involves four parties. (A local issuing bank, an overseas receiving bank, an importer and a beneficiary in overseas).How it works?Importer applies to local issuing bank, which then issues LoU in favour of overseas branches of Indian banks. Based on this, foreign branches issue buyers credit. Hence, in essence, LoU is a promise to pay. LoUs are communicated through a Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) instruction. A SWIFT instruction represents a consent from bank, which passes from multiple layers of checks. LoU is commonly used in Jewellery and Gems businesses, which involves large number of international commercial transactions.Allegations by PNBPNB stated that its two employees issued buyers credit allegedly and communicated SWIFT instructions to the overseas branches of Indian banks, without making entries in the banking system. The instructions were to raise LoUs for Nirav Modis firms, Diamond R US, Solar Exports, and Stellar Diamonds.Impact on PNBAccording to the complaint, the LoUs were issued for the overseas branches of Allahabad Bank and Axis Bank, post which these banks have given money to the beneficiary entity on behalf of Modis firms. As a result, (as per Hong Kong Monetary Authority norms) PNB will have to settle the LoUs with these branches. This may result in higher provisioning for the next few quarters in PNBs books if it is unable to recover the money.']"

The fortunes of the global generic pharma companies are increasingly tied to what happens in the US market. The USFDA, the most powerful drug regulator in the world, has become ever more demanding with the implementing the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments (GDUFA). The GDUFA and exchange of the data between the USFDA and top European regulators has led to increasing scrutiny of drug manufacturing facilities and incremental product approvals leading to price erosion.The effect is clearly visible in the share prices of the pharma companies. The market cap of three large pharma companies in India i.e. Sun Pharma, Lupin and Dr. Reddys have halved over the past two years. And then, there are also more no casualties beyond these three large companies. The increased regulatory pressure has brought immense volatility in the share prices and the business models. The way companies operate in USA, will change going ahead and this probably has hampered the confidence of the shareholders in these pharma companies.While the way forward, seems very unclear, Warren Buffet has shown that he believes in the generic pharma model. With the ever rising drug costs, affordable drugs are a way for the global healthcare. His investment in Teva, should be seen in this context. Tevas shares, over the past two years have lost two third of their value, and yet, Buffet bought ~2% stake in the company. He has a long term vision and impeccable understanding of the businesses he buys. Without a great foresight, he would not buy a share of company. This should be seen in a context that generics are here to stay and conditions, as and when ease, will be positive for the companies in this business.Indian pharma companies, which have established their front ends in the US markets and have presence from Japan to Latin America, would be beneficiary, when the pressure eases. Buffets investment in Teva, can be used as a signal to invest in the pharma companies.The Indian pharma companies are currently trading at their lowest valuation in many years. We could see more deals happening in the industry leading to more consolidation. If the pricing pressure eases in the next 18 months, as cited by pharma companies, Buffet would prove to be right in his investment in Teva.The question is, will the Indian investors follow the most successful investor in the word?']"

He warned clients to cash out before the Black Monday stock market crash in 1987, and helped clients profit handsomely as the Japanese stock bubble burst.But hes been a longtime Asia bull, and wrote an Amazon bestselling book predicting the continents rise, titled Tomorrows Gold: Asias Age of Discovery.Dr. Faber first came to India way back in 1973, but at the time it was difficult for a foreigner to invest in India. Thats changed now and hes taking advantage.During his presentation, Dr. Faber said the end of Western economic and political hegemony is coming, and Asias rise to the top is virtually unstoppable.We live in a new world, Dr. Faber said.Buthow should individuals investin this new world?Dr. Faberrecommends Indian stocks,real estate, bonds and commodities (with an emphasis on precious metals). Over the long run, they should all do very well.Specifically, Dr. Faber said hed wait for thecurrent correction in Indian stocks to take its course, before investing. He particularly likes financial service stocks.Dr. Faber offered two caveats to his predictionFirst isIndias growing and bureaucratic government. Dr. Faber said that government is a cancer, the smaller it is the better. He does, however, think the RBI is doing a wonderful job as a steward for the Indian economy, which is rare among central banks.Second, Indias rise depends on peace and stability in the region. The USA, who wont cede dominance easily, could play the role of troublemaker in the east. The USA has tens of thousands of troops spread around Asia.If both these threats can be avoided, India has the healthiest demographics in the world, and the long-term future of the country is incredibly prosperous.About Dr. Marc FaberDr. Faber is a Swiss investor, publisher of the Gloom Boom & Doom Report newsletter, and the director of Marc Faber Ltd, which acts as an investment advisor and fund manager. Dr. Faber earned his PhD in Economics from the University of Zurich, and has worked as an investment advisor for nearly 30 years.

The record date for the buy-back was set at February 5, 2018.The buy-back will involve allocation of 15% of the outlay to Small Shareholders, defined as shareholders with not more than holding value of Rs2lakhs on the record date. The reservation for the Small Shareholders, will be 193,500 equity shares, while that of the General category will be 1,096,500 equity shares.

CHAMPION is investigating whether Ferrings proprietary and heat-stable carbetocin could offer a new solution to prevent excessive bleeding after childbirth (postpartum haemorrhage or PPH).2,3Involving nearly 30,000 women in 10 countries, it is the largest clinical trial ever conducted in PPH.2,3This press release features multimedia. View the full release here:http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180221006496/en/Each year, 14 million mothers are affected by PPH.4As the leading direct cause of maternal mortality, 480,000 mothers died from PPH between 2003-09.1Even when women survive, PPH can result in the need for serious medical interventions, including surgical removal of the uterus (hysterectomy) as well as blood transfusions to address severe anaemia.5By preventing PPH from ever occurring, heat-stable carbetocin has the potential to both save lives and avoid severe, dangerous and costly long-term side effects.Despite progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goal of reducing maternal mortality, every single day women across the world are dying unnecessarily from childbirth complications such as PPH. Timely administration of effective medicines can avoid the maternal deaths that occur due to excessive bleeding after childbirth,6said Mariana Widmer, Technical Officer, Maternal and Perinatal Health, WHO. If the results of the trial for heat-stable carbetocin are favourable, this collaboration between private life sciences and the global public health community could help save womens lives worldwide.The CHAMPION trial compares the effectiveness and safety of Ferrings heat-stable carbetocin versus the current standard of care, oxytocin, for preventing PPH after vaginal birth.2,3Heat-stable carbetocin could address a significant limitation associated with oxytocin  the need for refrigeration during shipping and storage to prevent degradation in temperatures above 8°C.3,7Heat-stable carbetocin may remain active long-term in hot and humid climates,3and could potentially reduce the incidence of PPH in areas where cold storage is difficult to achieve and maintain,3,4and where 99% of maternal deaths due to PPH currently occur.4Using our established expertise in Reproductive Medicine and Womens Health, we strive to find innovative treatments that will help to dramatically reduce the number of mothers dying as a result of childbirth, said Professor Klaus Dugi, Chief Medical Officer, Ferring Pharmaceuticals. Our heat-stable carbetocin is just one example of this research effort and forms part of our ongoing commitment to safeguarding the health of families worldwide. We are looking forward to seeing the results from the CHAMPION trial and hope that the learnings will usher in a new era in the prevention of PPH.If the results of the CHAMPION trial are favourable, Ferring will seek registration of heat-stable carbetocin on a broad basis around the world. If approved, Ferring would manufacture the product and it would be provided to the public sector of low- and lower-middle-income countries at an affordable and sustainable access price. Results from the trial are expected to be presented and published during the second half of 2018.The CHAMPION trial has the potential to change the paradigm in how we save more mothers from dying during childbirth, said Julie L. Gerberding, M.D., M.P.H.

The Nippon Foundation has pledged US$2 million annually, and is calling for additional support from the global ocean community.Mr. Sasakawa noted, The Nippon Foundation alone cannot achieve the objectives of this ambitious project. We will need the support of diverse stakeholders, including maritime corporations and technical experts. It is crucial that the ocean community comes together to achieve this goal.He was joined by leading ocean-mapping experts, who emphasized that understanding the bathymetry of the global ocean is imperative for improving maritime navigation, and also for enhancing our ability to predict climate change and monitor marine biodiversity and resources. A comprehensive map of the seafloor will assist global efforts to combat pollution, aid marine conservation, forecast tsunami, and better understand tides, wave action, and sediment transport.Satinder Bindra, the projects recently appointed director, brings a wealth of experience, having previously worked for major international institutions involved in environmental initiatives and sustainable development. The project draws on the experience of a growing network of more than 28 institutions and organizations around the world. The project will operate in four Regional Centers, each with responsibility for a region of the worlds ocean, with a Global Center based at the UK National Oceanography Center.Notes to EditorsThe Nippon Foundationis a private, non-profit, philanthropic foundation established in 1962.

A few days ago, the Board had allotted 32.66cr shares to the promoters of Idea Cellular.

This is likely to be an outcome of implementation of resolution plan for large borrowers that are currently under Special Mention Accounts (SMA) categories. Further, in the event, the banks are unable to implement a resolution plans for the large borrowers with exposure of Rs2,000cr and above, these accounts will require to refer to National Company Law Tribunal for resolution under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016. This has been the case with most of the NCLT 2 list of borrowers, whereby the resolution plans failed for most of borrowers and were referred under IBC; this is expected to further spike up the credit provisioning requirements for banks during FY2019.Karthik Srinivasan, Group Head, Financial Sector Ratings, ICRA said, While in the short-term this will increase the pain for the borrowers as well the lenders, however the early identification of stress and resolution will prevent future ever-greening of loans and ensure a good financial health for the banking system in long-term.The revised RBI guidelines on resolution of stressed assets entail proactive resolution of the stressed assets whereby the lenders need to finalise the resolution plans as the accounts slips into SMA category. However unlike earlier Joint lender forum (JLF) framework, which formulated the resolution plans for SMA accounts; the revised guidelines also require the resolution plan to have independent credit evaluation (ICE) from credit rating agencies (CRAs) subject to a minimum credit opinion of ""RP4"" on scale of ""RP1"" to ""RP7"". In absence of the minimum requisite level of credit opinion, the resolution plan will not deemed to be implemented, and banks will need to initiate bankruptcy proceedings against these borrowers under Insolvency and bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016. To start with, the resolution plans of large borrowers with Rs100cr and above of exposure from banks will need ICE from CRAs.Also to prioritize the resolution in large stressed accounts, the timeline for large borrowers with exposure of Rs2,000cr and above needs to have a resolution plan with ICE approved by CRA before September 1, 2018, in absence of which banks will need to initiate bankruptcy proceedings against these borrowers under IBC. For accounts more than Rs100cr but less than Rs2,000cr, RBI will announce the timelines separately. The Gross NPAs and standard restructured advances of banks are estimated at 12.6% as on September 30, 2017.Additionally, as per the financial stability report of RBI, SMA 2 advances are estimated to be ~3.5% of the gross advances of banks. Hence the overall stress levels of banks including SMA0 and SMA1 borrowers is much higher than the reported GNPA level of 10.3% as on September 30, 2017.With 40 large accounts accounting for ~33% of the GNPAs of the banks already refereed by RBI for resolution under NCLT, lowering the threshold for resolution to Rs2,000cr per borrower will enlarge the overall quantum of debt being resolved on fast track basis.As per data compiled by ICRA for around 50 large borrowers have banking exposure of Rs2,000cr or more and will need resolution by September 1, 2018, the total borrowings of these companies stand at Rs2.46 lakh crore of debt. Some of these accounts are already classified as NPAs and may not add to overall stock of NPAs, however if the resolution plan entails restructuring of the loans, the standard loans will get classified as NPAs. Also, if the resolution plan fails to get implemented by September 1, 2018, the banks will need to initiate proceedings under IBC against these borrowers.Further, RBI has also tightened the criterion for up-gradation of NPA accounts or accounts which gets classified as NPAs upon restructuring under the resolution plan approved by JLF. The Accounts can be upgraded if the borrower has demonstrated track record of timely debt repayments and has paid at-least 20% of the principal outstanding at time of resolution plan, subject to a minimum investment grade credit rating form a CRA. This is against the earlier norm for restructured accounts, which is one year from the commencement of the first payment of interest or principal, whichever is later. With tightening of the criterion for up gradation of loans, the incentive for banks to defer the recognition of problem loans by creating a ballooning repayment schedule with back-ended amortization of principal will be discouraged, Karthik added.']"

As the two businesses are not inter-related and have different business dynamics, the company has indicated its business reorganization committee to come up with alternative strategies of re-organization or demerger of its two business verticals.The talks of de-merger of its Lighting and Consumer Durables business have been going on since almost 1-2 years. However, subdued performance of its Steel Pipes & Strips division was a concern, which may have prevented a smooth demerger. Therefore, in 2016 the company merged its associate company, Surya Global Steel Tubes (SGSTL) in its Steel division. SGSTL is an exports-focused unit with cost advantages over others, and hence, the merger is expected to improve margin and returns of its steel business as well. Hence, we believe the de-merger will benefit both the verticals, as they will be able to focus on their core competencies and follow an independent growth trajectory.For 9MFY18 and Q3FY18 the companys Lighting and Consumer Durables divisions performance has been good despite GST related disruptions. The segment's sales (net of excise duty and GST for yoy comparison) have grown by 5.1% yoy each in 9MFY18 and Q3FY18 to reach Rs984.4cr and Rs338.1cr respectively. During 9MFY18, lighting division has contributed ~28% to total revenues of the company. Light-emitting diode (LED) lights are a main product of this division which has grown 38% yoy during 9MFY18.In FY17, Lighting and Consumer Durables division had revenue of ~Rs1,349cr and contributed ~40% to its revenues. The ROCE for this business in FY17 was ~17%. In this division, lighting business of the company had been impacted due to phasing out of compact fluorescent lightbulbs (CFL) from the market as a result of migration towards light-emitting diode (LEDs), which is a better quality and more energy-efficient option. The company has recently launched premium range of LED down-lighters, street lights and flood lights. The company has also obtained contracts for supply of LED street lights and other lighting products worth Rs220cr (exclusive of taxes) from EESL. As per the companys 2016-17 annual report, it is enjoying 18-20% market share in the LED lighting organized market. Therefore, lighting business is expected to deliver healthy performance going forward.The Lighting and Consumer Durables division also includes appliances such as fans, kitchen appliances, etc. During FY17, the volume growth in LED business was 77% yoy, whereas the fan and home appliances business grew by 55% yoy. In FY17, the fans segment had 3% market share of the total Indian fan market and achieved sales of Rs180cr in FY17.Surya Roshni has wide spread market network of over 2,000 distributors and 2 lakh countrywide retailers across PAN India and exports to over 25 countries globally, across the Middle East, Europe, Africa and Asia.We believe de-merger of its business verticals will help the company unlock value in its Lighting and Consumer Durables division.\xa0 Currently, the companys TTM P/E is 34.5x (source: Bloomberg). However, its competitors in the lighting and consumer electrical products - Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals, Havells India and Bajaj Electricals trade at higher TTM P/Ex of ~52x, ~67x and ~52x respectively.Surya Roshni Ltd is currently trading at Rs 492.25, down by Rs 5.1 or 1.03% from its previous closing of Rs 497.35 on the BSE.""]"

While the taxes could be either the ones paid directly by the taxpayers such as Income tax or the indirect ones such as GST (Goods and Services Tax).,"['You might have often heard these two terms: tax return and a tax refund from the people around you. Though it might sound very confusing, these two terms mean entirely different. A tax refund and a tax return are the most commonly used terms of a tax system. While the taxes could be either the ones paid directly by the taxpayers such as Income tax or the indirect ones such as GST (Goods and Services Tax). It is important that you are clear with the terminology in order to avoid blunders, especially when communicating with the concerned person such as your CA (Chartered Accountant).So it is very important that you understand the difference of the two terms in order to use them correctly wherever required and avoid making confusions.What is Tax Return?A tax return or popularly known as Income Tax Return (ITR) is the information required by the Income Tax Department regarding your annual gross income across different sources, tax liabilities, tax that has been paid and the refunds (in case any: if the tax paid is higher than the tax owed) that the government is supposed to give.Income Tax Return has filed annually with the Income Tax Department disclosing the above information.

While in a case when the tax paid is lower than the amount owed, you need to pay the further balance.You can file a return easily online on the ITR e-filing portal until the 31stJuly.What is Tax Refund?A tax refund comes into the picture when the tax that has already been paid is higher than the actual tax you are required to pay. A Tax refund is a difference between the tax you have paid and the actual tax payable, which is calculated only upon filing the income tax return.Once you file the return, then only you are entitled to ask for a refund. A refund is processed only upon a thorough assessment of the return filed for the respective year. If you are looking for the tax refund, then it is important that you file your return properly. As the information filled while filing the tax return would be used while you get a tax refund.Difference between Tax Return and Tax RefundA tax return is the filing of details including total annual gross income, advance tax or TDS (tax deduction at source) paid, the tax liabilities and based on this the subsequent refund could be claimed from the government.This refund is calculated based on the information provided in the tax return and thus impact whether you are eligible to get a refund or not, in case eligible then how much shall be refunded directly.Hence, it is always advised to file the returns properly in time (before July 31) with accuracy in order to avoid any further consequences and to get your refund easily. It is the authenticity of the information provided during a return which plays the key role while getting your refund approved.']"

The resultant OGPL will be a wind based Independent Power Producer with a portfolio of 425MW at attractive tariffs.Our focused efforts to reduce interest costs have received a significant boost with the transfer of biomass debts as well as refinancing of a large tranche of debt in the wind business. Lastly, a dramatic improvement in REC volumes in the months of November and December, 2017 has enabled us to monetize a large part of our inventory further enhancing our financial position. The combination of these factors has already resulted in strengthening of cash flows over the last two years even as the company has delivered an elevated and sustainable level of profitability.With a leaner business model, rationalization of debt and finance costs, continued impact of strategic initiatives supported by tailwinds in the form of improved macros and favorable demand for RECs, we are confident that we would be able to maintain the current momentum in the business and accelerate value creation for our stakeholders.Performance UpdateWind Business  Strong revenue traction & revival in profitability on the back of improving macros & timely onset of wind seasonBetter wind availability and grid infrastructure during 9MFY18 resulted in higher revenue and unit generation; higher by 9% & 1% on an yearly basisThere has been a marked improvement of Grid Availability at approximately 95% in Tamil Nadu over the last 12-15 months.

Now, our digital-first portfolio for customers in utilities, industry and transport and infrastructure is based on two clear value propositions: bringing electricity from any power plant to any plug, and automating industries from natural resources to finished products, said ABB CEO Ulrich Spiesshofer. The annual results include the dampening effect of our massive transformation. With our targeted actions to shift our center of gravity, we have improved competitiveness, addressed higher-growth segments and de-risked ABB. We delivered four consecutive quarters of increasing base-order growth. The momentum we have built in 2017 positions us for profitable growth as the global markets are improving. Todays proposal to increase the dividend for the 9th consecutive year demonstrates our confidence in the future.KEY FIGURESCHANGECHANGE($ in millions, unless otherwise indicated)Q42017Q42016US$Comparable1FY 2017FY 2016US$Comparable1Orders8,4788,277+2%-3%33,38733,3790%0%Revenues9,2808,993+3%-1%34,31233,828+1%+1%Operational EBITA21,0211,057-3%-7%34,1304,191-1%-2%3as % of operational revenues10.9%11.7%-0.8pts12.1%12.4%-0.3ptsNet income attributable to ABB393425-8%2,2131,899+17%Basic EPS ($)0.180.20-7%41.040.88+17%4Operational EPS2($)0.330.33-2%4+2%41.251.29-4%4-1%4Cash flow from operating activities1,8691,428+31%3,7993,843-1%Free cash flow22,9263,065-5%Cash return on invested capital (CROI)212.4%13.8%-1.4ptsShort-term outlookMacroeconomic signs are trending positively in Europe and the United States, with growth expected to continue in China. The overall global market is back to growth whilst still impacted by uncertainties in various parts of the world. Oil prices and foreign exchange translation effects are expected to continue to influence the companys results.Full-year 2017 Group ResultsABB delivered a steady financial performance in 2017 despite market headwinds and its ongoing transformation. Total orders were steady (steady in US dollars). Base-order growth (base orders are classified as orders below $15 million) showed increasing momentum each quarter, and for the full year increased 5 percent (6 percent in US dollars), mitigating the effect of lower large orders. The large order share of total orders in 2017 was 8.5 percent, versus 13.5 percent in 2016, in part as a consequence of ABBs business model shift. Total service orders grew 8 percent (8 percent in US dollars) to 20 percent of total group orders.The order backlog at the end of December 2017 was $22,414 million, 4 percent lower (2 percent in US dollars) compared with the prior year. The book-to-bill ratio2was 0.97x for 2017, compared with 0.99x in 2016.Revenues improved 1 percent (1 percent in US dollars) to $34,312 million, with positive contributions from Electrification Products and Robotics and Motion more than offsetting the declines in Industrial Automation and Power Grids. Total services revenues grew 3 percent (3 percent in US dollars) and now stand at 18 percent of total group revenues.ABB executed on its Next Level strategy throughout 2017. The company launched ABB AbilityTM, its digital solutions offering, and continued to invest in digital, sales, branding and research & development. It delivered strong cost savings in White Collar Productivity and supply chain/operational excellence and completed or announced a number of important transactions. It continued to de-risk its portfolio by divesting non-core businesses, and taking actions to implement its EPC (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) business model change. These activities impacted full year results. The companys operational EBITA declined 2 percent (1 percent in US dollars) to $4,130 million, inclusive of approximately $140 million of charges related to the EPC businesses. The reported operational EBITA margin was 12.1 percent, 30 basis points lower due to charges related to the EPC businesses and would have been steady without these charges.Net income in 2017 rose 17 percent compared with the previous year to $2,213 million, reflecting primarily lower transformation-related restructuring and restructuring-related expenses and net gains recorded on the business divestments in the year. Basic earnings per share grew 17 percent to $1.04. Operational EPS2was $1.25, 1 percent lower in constant currency4.Cash flow from operating activities was steady compared with 2016 at $3,799 million for the full year. ABB continued to benefit from improvements in net working capital which generated approximately $600 million of cash during 2017. Net working capital as a percentage of revenues2was reduced to 11.3 percent, a 10 basis point improvement year on year. Capital expenditures for the group were $949 million during 2017. Free cash flow2of $2,926 million was 5 percent lower than 2016 and the companys cash return on invested capital (CROI) was 12.4 percent2, mainly impacted by the acquisition of B&R.DividendABBs board has proposed the 9th consecutive increase in the ordinary dividend to 0.78 Swiss francs per share for 2017, an increase of 0.02 Swiss francs compared with the dividend distribution for the year 2016, subject to shareholder approval at the companys annual general meeting on March 29, 2018. The proposal is in line with ABBs dividend policy to pay a steadily rising, sustainable dividend over time. The ex-dividend and payout dates in Switzerland are expected to be in April 2018. Further information is available on ABBs website.Q4 2017 Group resultsOrdersTotal orders were 3 percent lower (2 percent higher in US dollars) in the fourth quarter as strong base order development could not offset the impact of lower large orders in Power Grids and Industrial Automation compared with the exceptionally strong prior year period. Base orders improved 9 percent (15 percent in US dollars), with third-party base order growth in all divisions. Large orders represented 7 percent of total orders compared with 17 percent in the prior year period. A weaker US dollar versus the prior year period resulted in a positive translation impact of 3 percent on reported orders. Changes in the business portfolio related to the acquisition of B&R and the divestments made in 2017 had a net positive impact of 2 percent on total reported orders. The book-to-bill ratio was 0.91x in the fourth quarter compared with 0.92x in the fourth quarter of 2016.Total services orders grew 7 percent (11 percent in US dollars), increasing service orders as a percentage of total orders to 21 percent, versus 20 percent in the same period last year.Market overviewRegional demand patterns were positive in the fourth quarter:Europe benefited from positive market developments in industry and infrastructure. Total orders improved 5 percent (19 percent in US dollars), with positive contributions from Germany and Norway more than offsetting declines in the UK, Italy and Sweden. Base orders rose 8 percent (23 percent in US dollars) with positive order trends in Germany, Norway and Italy.The Americas grew 3 percent (5 percent in US dollars) driven by increased demand in construction and general industries and some improvement in process industries. Orders from the United States and Canada contributed to this growth, offsetting large order weakness in Brazil. Base orders for the region grew 12 percent (14 percent in US dollars), with strong contribution from the United States, Canada and Brazil.Asia, Middle East and Africa (AMEA) orders were 14 percent lower (12 percent in US dollars) as the exceptionally large ultra-high-voltage direct current (UHVDC) order that was awarded in the fourth quarter 2016 in India was not repeated. Total orders in China were moderately lower, down 3 percent (2 percent higher in US dollars) with 1 percent base order growth (6 percent in US dollars). Base orders for the region increased 6 percent (8 percent in US dollars) with positive base order development from India, South Korea and Australia.In ABBs key customer segments, the following trends were observed:Utility customers continued to integrate renewables globally, add new capacity in emerging markets and invest in energy efficiency. This resulted in strong base order growth for ABBs products including transformers, as well as ABBs automation and digital solutions.In industry, ABB saw strong demand from the automotive and general industry sectors for robotic solutions. Process industries, including oil and gas and mining, showed some first signs of recovery, however customer investment decisions remained highly selective.Transport & infrastructure demand was mixed. Transport orders were subdued in the marine sector, with the exception of cruise ships, while demand for building automation solutions remained strong. Data centers and electric vehicle charging orders were a highlight in the quarter.RevenuesRevenues were 1 percent lower (3 percent higher in US dollars) as solid growth in Robotics and Motion was offset by the revenue decline in Power Grids. The Industrial Automation and Electrification Products divisions had steady revenues. Service revenues were 7 percent higher (11 percent in US dollars) and represented 20 percent of total revenues, compared with 19 percent a year ago. A weaker US dollar versus the prior year period resulted in a positive translation impact on reported revenues of 3 percent. Changes in the business portfolio related to the acquisitions of B&R and the divestments made in 2017 had a net negative 1 percent impact on total reported revenues.Operational EBITAOperational EBITA was $1,021 million, 7 percent lower in constant currency (3 percent in US dollars). Positive net savings actions that lifted operational EBITA were more than offset by the approximately $140 million of charges related to the EPC businesses. As well the impacts from volume, net commodity prices and investments in growth lowered the results. The reported operational EBITA margin for the quarter was 10.9 percent, 150 basis points lower due to charges related to the EPC businesses and would have been higher without these charges.Net income, basic and operational earnings per shareNet income was $393 million, 8 percent lower in US dollars and in addition to the items described above was also impacted by higher restructuring and restructuring-related expenses, the loss from the divestment of the Oil & Gas EPC business as well as changes in foreign currency and commodity timing differences. Basic earnings per share of $0.18 was 7 percent lower compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. Operational earnings per share of $0.33 was 2 percent higher in constant currency terms4.Cash flow from operating activitiesCash flow from operating activities was $1,869 million, an increase of 31 percent on the $1,428 million delivered in the same quarter of 2016. The result was supported by stronger working capital improvements in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with 2016 reflecting improvements in collections from customers.Q4 divisional performance($ in millions, unless otherwise indicated)OrdersCHANGE3rdpartybaseordersCHANGERevenuesCHANGEOpEBITA %CHANGEUS$Comparable1US$Comparable1US$Comparable1Electrification Products2,556+12%+10%2,394+10%+8%2,696+2%-1%14.7%+1.4ptsRobotics and Motion2,040+10%+6%1,838+10%+5%2,187+10%+6%10.8%-3.1ptsIndustrial Automation1,796+16%-1%1,638+26%+5%2,012+15%0%14.8%-0.4ptsPower Grids2,493-13%-16%1,994+18%+15%2,809-5%-7%7.8%-2.8ptsCorporate & other (incl. inter-division elimination)-40718-424ABB Group8,478+2%-3%7,882+15%+9%9,280+3%-1%10.9%-0.8ptsElectrification ProductsTotal orders were 10 percent higher (12 percent in US dollars), as all regions and end markets showed strong demand, in particular for data center, food and beverage and electric vehicle fast-charging solutions. Third-party base orders increased 8 percent (10 percent in US dollars). Revenues declined 1 percent (2 percent higher in US dollars), as increases in short-cycle revenues were not enough to offset lower system revenues. Operational EBITA margin of 14.7 percent was aided by cost savings and improved pricing despite ongoing commodity price headwinds.Robotics and MotionTotal orders improved 6 percent (10 percent in US dollars), growing in all regions. The division saw improved demand from process end markets, whilst large orders declined due to the timing of tender awards. Third-party base orders grew 5 percent (10 percent in US dollars). Revenues were 6 percent higher (10 percent in US dollars) on strong execution of the order backlog. The operational EBITA margin of 10.8 percent was primarily impacted by the charges related to the EPC business and continued higher material costs. These EPC charges negatively impacted the operational EBITA margin by 300 basis points.Industrial AutomationThird-party base orders continued to be positive at 5 percent on continued operational investment by process customers; total orders declined 1 percent. Selective capital expenditure was seen in mining and specialty vessels. Including B&R and currency effects, the total reported order growth was 16 percent and revenue growth 15 percent. Revenues were steady reflecting the strong book and bill within the quarter. The operational EBITA margin of 14.8 percent reflects the digital investments and negative business mix. The joint venture completed with Arkad was established before the end of the year and the results of that divested business have been excluded from the results of the division and reported under Corporate and Other in all periods.Power GridsThird-party base orders grew 15 percent (18 percent in US dollars) mainly driven by industry, particularly in transportation and infrastructure. Total orders declined 16 percent (13 percent in US dollars) due to the exceptionally large UHVDC order that was awarded in India in 2016. The division continues to drive business model changes as it further expands its digital and service offering. Revenues were 7 percent lower (5 percent in US dollars) due to the lower order backlog, primarily in EPC. The operational EBITA margin of 7.8 percent was impacted by charges related to the EPC business. Excluding this charge, the divisions margin would have been 240 basis points higher. The divisions Power Up program, driving its transformation and value creation, is underway.Next Level strategy  stage 3ABB is delivering on its Next Level strategy to unlock value and deliver attractive shareholder returns. 2017 was a transition year, in which the company streamlined and strengthened its portfolio and operations. ABB shifted its center of gravity to a simplified, strengthened digital and market-leading portfolio. It completed and announced a number of key acquisitions, divested certain businesses and implemented business model changes. ABB strengthened its operations through the completion of its 1,000-day execution programs. It continued to focus on operational excellence, delivering supply chain and operational cost savings. A number of key Executive Committee appointments were made in 2017 while continuing to focus on leadership development and bringing all of ABB under one unified brand. With these transformational actions complete, ABB is positioned for profitable growth.Profitable growthAs part of the drive towards profitable growth, ABB made significant progress in 2017 to streamline and strengthen its portfolio. Base order growth momentum continued each quarter and was higher in all divisions and regions.With the launch of ABB AbilityTM, in March 2017, ABB is making a quantum leap in digital. With more than 210 ABB AbilityTMsolutions available today, ABB is leveraging its large installed base of connected systems and devices. ABB AbilityTMis a solution-led approach based on ABBs leading portfolio and domain expertise. It has a secure, open architecture ranging from edge to cloud. ABB AbilityTMis central to ABBs strategy to drive growth through expansion of high value-add solutions and services.Through active portfolio management, ABB is streamlined and strengthened. These actions continue to shift ABBs center of gravity towards strengthened competitiveness, higher growth segments and lower risk.ABB strengthened its position as the #2 industrial automation player globally by completing the acquisition of B&R in July. With this acquisition, ABB closed its historic gap in machine and factory automation and created a uniquely comprehensive automation portfolio for customers globally. The integration of B&R is well underway and fully on track.ABB acquired the mission-critical communication network business from the Keymile Group to strengthen its portfolio and further enhance ABB AbilityTM. It adds reliable communications technologies that are essential to maintain todays dynamic and complex digital electrical grids. The acquisition brings with it products, software and service solutions, as well as research and development expertise.On September 25, ABB announced an agreement to acquire GE Industrial Solutions (GE IS), General Electrics global electrification solutions business. GE IS has deep customer relationships in more than 100 countries and an established installed base with strong roots in North America, ABBs biggest market. Through this purchase, ABB will strengthen its #2 position in electrification globally and expand its access to the attractive North American market. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2018.ABB continued to shape its portfolio with the divestment of its high-voltage cables and cable accessories business to NKT Cables, completed on March 1, 2017.During the fourth quarter, actions were implemented across three divisions to complete the business model change for EPC. In the Power Grids division, consistent with ABBs shift in focus away from non-core EPC activity, ABB signed an agreement to form a joint venture with SNC-Lavalin for electrical substation EPC projects; SNC-Lavalin is expected to have a majority interest. In the Industrial Automation division, ABB completed the formation of an oil & gas EPC joint venture with Arkad Engineering and Construction Ltd., a fully integrated EPC contractor for the energy sector based in Saudi Arabia. In Robotics and Motion, ABB announced that it was exiting its turnkey full train retrofit business, beyond meeting its current contractual commitments. ABB will report remaining EPC activities related to these businesses as a non-core operating unit within Corporate & Other, effective January 1, 2018.Relentless executionIn 2017, ABB continued to drive towards further streamlining and strengthening its operations. At the end of 2017, the company concluded its strategic 1,000-day programs. The companys White Collar Productivity program produced a run-rate of more than $1.3 billion of gross savings by the end of 2017, more than $300 million ahead of original ambitions. The savings program was delivered within the announced timeframe and with approximately $300 million lower combined restructuring and implementation costs than originally expected. Excluding the impacts of business portfolio changes, working capital was $1.9 billion lower. Improved net working capital discipline freed up $1.5 billion of cash and reduced net working capital as a percentage of revenues by 280 basis points since the end of 2014. Working capital management has improved across all division and regions since the program was initiated. Further net working capital benefits are targeted from ongoing inventory optimization.Business-led collaborationABB has completed its transition to a simpler, leaner and more customer-focused business while at the same time linking executive compensation firmly to performance and delivery of strategy.A number of key Executive Committee appointments were made in the year. Effective April 1, 2017, Timo Ihamuotila joined ABB from Nokia as Chief Financial Officer and a member of the Executive Committee. Effective July 1, 2017, Chunyuan Gu, Managing Director of ABB in China, became President of the Asia, Middle East and Africa (AMEA) region and a member of the Executive Committee. Chunyuan took over AMEA from Frank Duggan, who was appointed President of the Europe region.A focus on leadership development remains key to ensuring the companys leadership is fully empowered to meet its growth agenda along with the alignment of all activities under the unified and strengthened ABB brand.Short- and long-term outlookMacroeconomic signs are trending positively in Europe and the United States, with growth expected to continue in China. The overall global market is back to growth whilst still impacted by uncertainties in various parts of the world. Oil prices and foreign exchange translation effects are expected to continue to influence the companys results.The attractive long-term demand outlook in ABBs three major customer sectors  utilities, industry and transport & infrastructure  is driven by the Energy and Fourth Industrial Revolutions. ABB is well-positioned to tap into these opportunities for long-term profitable growth with its strong market presence, broad geographic and business scope, technology leadership and financial strength.More informationThe Q4 2017 results press release and presentation slides are available on the ABB News Center atwww.abb.com/newsand on the Investor Relations homepage atwww.abb.com/investorrelations.ABB will host a press conference today starting at 10:00 a.m. Central European Time (CET) (9:00 a.m. BST, 4:00 a.m. EDT).

Visas cashless solutions offer the freedom to pay anywhere in the world while helping you get a competitive exchange rate when you pay in local currency.

(Photo: Business Wire)2018 Macro Trends in TravelIn addition to examining the motivations and planning tactics, the GTI Study of outbound travelers from 27 countries and territories also uncovered a number of macro trends expected to continue into 2018:Trips are getting shorter:The global average is now eight nights, down from 10 nights on average in 2013.More trips abroad: Globally, people are planning to take more trips in the future, from an average of 2.5 trips in the past two years to 2.7 trips in the next two years. The Americas lead the pack in number of trips in the past two years, taking an average of 3.2 trips in 2017.Technology is helping some travelers better navigate their destinations:88 percent of travelers gained online access while abroad. Almost half (44 percent) use ride-sharing apps to get around once they are on the ground.Multi-destination:11 percent of global travel includes visits to multiple countries.Japan, the United States and Australia are the most visited countries:Japan has overtaken the United States as the most popular destination for global travelers in the past two years. Regional preferences prevail, though, with travelers in the Asia Pacific region leaning heavily toward Japan as a travel destination. American travelers prefer continental Europe, though Mexico, Canada and Japan are also highly desirable.Top spenders:Saudi Arabians are the top spenders when it comes to what travelers spend on their entire trips, including the booking stage as well as expenditures at the destination, with Chinese, Australians, Americans and Kuwaitis rounding out the top five.Simplifying Payment AbroadTravelers are increasingly using technology to plan their trips and navigate their destinations  83 percent of travelers used technology for this purpose in 2017 compared to 78 percent in 2015. Yet the majority of them are still decidedly analog when it comes to making payments internationally.While many travelers use cards while on vacation, most (77 percent) still prefer to use cash when making purchases. Using a Visa card to pay in local currency could help international travelers get a more competitive exchange rate and possibly help them avoid being hit with hidden currency conversion fees when they get home. The Study also found the following themes related to the use of cash while traveling internationally:Cash causes anxiety:Travelers cited loss of cash or theft as a top money concern while on trips.Big Spenders:The average global traveler spends US$1,793 per trip, yet the global median amount of cash brought to destination globally clocks in at a whopping US$7781.Trade-off:In order to travel with that much cash, 72 percent of people prepared their foreign currency prior to their departure date.Telling sign:Only slightly more than one in ten people made an ATM withdrawal at their destination. Security at ATMs is one area of concern affecting this statistic, cited by nearly one in five travelers as a barrier to using an ATM. Travelers from Europe, the Middle East and Africa are, however, more likely to withdraw cash during vacation compared to those from other regions.Leftover cash:A whopping 87 percent have leftover cash after their trips, but only 29 percent convert it back to currency they can actually use at home. The global median leftover amount is US$123.We are excited to see the desire for global travel grow as technology becomes integral in every stage of the travelers journey, said Lynne Biggar, Chief Marketing and Communications Officer, Visa. Using your Visa card abroad means a safe, secure, seamless and convenient experience, without the worry of carrying cash. As more people travel internationally in 2018, we look forward to helping travelers make the most of their trips.Tips for Stress-Free Payment While TravelingUse your Visa card topay in local currencyto get a competitive exchange rate and help avoid getting stuck with hidden currency conversion fees when you get home.Use a credit or debit card\xa0for purchases. Visa offers security, convenience and ease when paying abroad. It may be considered safer than carrying cash, and is backed byVisas Zero Liability Policy2, which states accountholders wont be held responsible for unauthorized charges on their account.Whenever possible, pay through achip-activated terminalwhen using your credit or debit card for enhanced security.Look for theVisa or PLUS logo at any point-of-sale terminal or ATMto ensure these international payment cards are accepted.More GTI FindingsThe average global traveler spends US$1,793 per trip.

It also showcased refreshed versions of its existing scooters, Maestro Edge and Duet.Till date, HMCL has been focussing mainly on commuter segment motorcycles starting from sub-100cc motorcycles such as HF Dawn to the 150cc Xtreme Sports. With the unveiling of Hero XPulse 200 and Xtreme 200, it is marking its entry into the fast growing high engine capacity motorcycle segment. Both models are expected to be launched in FY2019.Apart from these, the company also showcased two scooter models, the 200cc versions of its existing Duet and Maestro Edge scooters. These will be upgraded from 110cc currently to 125cc and will be launched in Q2FY19. The scooter segment has been growing at a scorching pace in India. SIAM expects two wheeler volumes to grow at 12% in FY18, motorcycles at 11% and scooters at 20%. Hence, all two wheeler OEMs are hitting the market with regular scooter launches.While speaking at the Auto Expo 2018, Chairman Mr. Pawan Munjal said that HMCL would look at organic, inorganic and partnership led growth in the coming years. It plans to introduce several premium motorcycles over the next 6-18 months. However, it would continue to do so without losing focus on its core commuter motorcycle segment.For Q3FY18, HMCL benefitted from low base of Q3FY17 and logged 16% yoy volume growth. However, it was unable to enjoy growth in realizations, which slumped 1% yoy in Q3FY18. This was in sharp contrast to TVSM and BJAUT, which saw their realizations grow 7% yoy each. Exports comprise only ~2% of total volumes. Despite HMCL being a late entrant into the export market, it plans to double the number of countries that it exports to, from 20 to 40 over next few years. The very size of 2W markets in developing countries presents a huge growth opportunity for HMCL.

Nothing in life comes free. Though kids will understand it eventually as they grow older, it is important for them to grasp this concept at a very young age.","['One of the biggest oversights in our education system is the fact we dont have curriculum teaching children about money from a young age. It is even more surprising when you see that as adults they are least aware of this important part of their lives.Hence, as parents, it becomes your duty to educate your children about money to prepare them for the future. Parents can help them understand that financial decision-making is a necessary quality from a young age.While it is never too late to explain to your child about the money, you cant explain credit cards and loans to a 5-year-old. You have to take baby steps towards educating them in stages. This will help them grasp the concept of money from a younger age and understand it better.Here are a few suggestions of things you can teach them at each age period:Age 8-10The most basic lesson about money is that you have to pay money to buy something. Nothing in life comes free. Though kids will understand it eventually as they grow older, it is important for them to grasp this concept at a very young age.Teach them about the value of each note and coin by telling them the prices of everyday household things. For example, a toffee costs Rs. 1 but a larger chocolate costs Rs. 20.Age 10-12Now that your child understands the value of money for different products, the next step is teaching them the basics of savings and expenditure. You can give your child an allowance every month and ask them to split the money and put it into two jars  a spending jar and a saving jar.Discuss out loud and analyse together whether you really need a particular product or if you could do without it. This helps them understand not to buy products just because they are on sale.Age 12-15When your child is in their teens and on the cusp of leaving school and entering college at the right age to learn to about banks, interest and the benefits of saving money sooner rather than later. Take your kids to the bank and open a minor Savings Account for them. Teach them about interest rates, compound interest and how you can make more money by saving at a young age.Ask your child to save for that guitar or cricket kit that they have always wanted. Since they are slightly expensive, your child will learn to say no to unnecessary expenditures like chocolate to buy something he is more passionate about.Age 16-18Now that your kid is in his late teens, it is essential to be open and discuss college-education expenditure. Be upfront in telling your kid how much of the expense you can handle so that they dont have unrealistic expectations about college.

Even a small mistake can cause a big loss. Market trends could be classified based on two criteria - market direction and time period.","['Trends: its classification and importanceTo get good returns out of the investments in share market, one has to be updated with the current market trend. Even a small mistake can cause a big loss. Market trends could be classified based on two criteria - market direction and time period. Based on market direction there are two types of trends: Uptrend and downtrend. While an uptrend has high highs and low lows, a downtrend has lower highs and higher lows. An uptrend can also be termed as Bullish trend and a downtrend can be termed as Bearish trend.There are three types of market trends based on time period: short, intermediate and long term trends. These can also be termed as minor, secondary and primary trends respectively. One has to carefully study the trend on time scale and make investments accordingly so as to gain well out of it.Primary trend is a long term and the most important trend because it sets the tone for the other two trends. While it generally lasts for one to three years, unless a clear sign of trend reversal, it is considered as the main trend. In case of an uptrend the highs will be constantly higher than the previous one. While for the downtrend the lows will constantly fall lower.The Secondary trend is a temporary price movement within the primary trend in the contrary direction lasting for three weeks to three months. Each primary trend consists of several secondary trends within it.Minor trend is a very short term trend within the secondary trend whose duration lasts for a few days to a week. It is contrary to the direction of a secondary trend but doesnt impact much.All the three trends give information about the stock prices. But, only the primary and secondary trends hold actual importance when it comes to profit making. Because minor trends effect is not too long or deep. While most attention is to be paid to the primary trend, the secondary trend also holds due importance especially when it is a downtrend, and could be used to buy more stocks. These stocks could add up to the profit which can be earned with the ongoing primary uptrend.How to find an ongoing trend?To locate an ongoing trend look for the lows in different time periods like 6 months, 1 year, 3 years and so on. Try to draw a trend line by marking all the lowest lows. See if the trend line goes upwards or downwards depicting a primary up or a low trend. One could easily locate a few secondary trends within a primary trend by seeing the duration of trend lines.Image source: StockCharts.comHow to find a trend reversal?To find a trend reversal one has to look for three things: a broken trend line, a retest and failure, and price falls below the prior low. Like we have drawn a trend line above by marking all the lows, similarly, draw a trend line and check if there is any deviation in the trend line.Image source: StockCharts.comA broken trend line might not always show a trend reversal, it could just be temporary downfall and trend might continue back. So as to confirm retest in some time. Check if the uptrend still makes higher highs and lower lows, if it fails and the stock no longer makes higher highs, then we have to check for the final confirmation before taking any call on the trend reversal.Image source: StockCharts.comIf the price further continues to fall below the prior low it confirms that there is a trend reversal and is the correct time to jump off the stocks.Image source: StockCharts.comMost investors invest in an uptrend, stay there until they find any weakness, which indicates a slowdown. This indicator could tell the right time to take the profit and jump off. It is always important to keep an eye on the trend. A recent uptrend may not always indicate a bullish market. A steady rise might look like an uptrend but it might just be a rebound from the previous sharp drop. Therefore, the above analysis comes into the picture to help in determining trends and decision making.']"

Not only was it the final budget before the 2019 general elections, but strong rumours of a populist Budget were sending all sorts of mixed signals to various industries.In any case, all sectors - and specifically real estate - had harboured considerable hopes from this Budget. Battered and bruised after demonetization, RERA and GST, the sector looked forward to at least some major announcements that could re-inject the market into a growth trajectory.Above all, real estate players fervently hoped for the long-awaited and long-elusive infrastructure status. The logistics sector and affordable housing had received it sometime back, but the market needs the benefits of infrastructure status on a much broader spectrum. Expectations notwithstanding, the real estate industry got neither infrastructure status or, for that matter, any additional direct policy push from Union Budget 2018-19.Why is infrastructure status so important for any sector?How can this status impact the countrys economy at large? What would have happened if infrastructure status had been granted to the real estate sector? The infographic below highlights the positive implications:However, giving infrastructure to the real estate sector goes far beyond the above benefits. Given the Governments ambitious vision of Housing for all by 2022, it has a very direct stake in helping the real estate industry get back on track. With rising demand and improving profitability, private players will be more than willing to be a part of the journey to achieve this ambitious mission. There would be increased real estate activity not only in the metros and larger cities but also in Tier II/Tier III cities.Instead of providing the real estate sector infrastructure status, Union Budget 2018-19 gave a minor boost to the Housing for All scheme with a stated intention to build 51 lakh homes in rural areas and 37 lakh urban houses. While this is commendable, it firstly hinges on actual implementation and secondly is an exceedingly slow and cautious approach where the Housing for all by 2022 scheme actually calls for a very aggressive slant.Infrastructure status to the real estate sector would have been a major structural reform that could have boosted the GDP, increased employment opportunities, lowered the cost of home development and purchase, and led to rapid growth of the sector.Santhosh Kumar, Vice Chairman, ANAROCK Property Consultants']"

The environment in which you execute this strategy is called culture.Mr. Murthy concluded with his views on the insurance industry today: Insurance has not yet penetrated in a major way in India, both at the corporate and personal levels. As India develops, more corporations would need to be covered by insurance. Hence, insurance companies have tremendous unexplored value.The Fireside chat was followed by a panel discussion on Pushing the boundaries of risk - imagining a new context - past, present and future with insurance veterans Bhargav Dasgupta - MD & CEO, ICICI Lombard General Insurance, Chandrasekar Pranatharthi -\xa0Group Head - Insurance at RPG GROUP, Sandeep Bakhshi -\xa0MD and CEO, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co, Shankar Garigiparthy -\xa0Country Manager & CEO, India, Lloyd\'s & Varun Dua -\xa0CEO, Acko General Insurance.

Today theres a large scope of improvement which insurance partners like Anviti can bring to the table. Brokers can play an important and valuable role beyond just providing a product.

This will help you to talk freely to your children and the other way around.

Do not invest in stocks because people around are also investing in it. Avoid such practices as they do not yield well in long term and often end up with heavy loss.,"['It is always said that one can make large amounts of wealth in the stock market, but at the same time there remains a risk of losing it as well. So, it is very important to be careful while investing so that we could earn money instead of losing in the stock market. It largely depends on the stock which you are investing in, and the time when you are buying and selling it.Following are a few tips which would be quite helpful in making money in the stock market:Be a fundamental investor instead of a speculator:A fundamental investor is the one who invests by giving more importance to the fundamental strength of the company instead of the stock price. A fundamental investor shifts his focus to valuation only upon being completely satisfied by the fundamental strength of the company. While a speculator gives utmost importance to the stock price, it is much riskier in practice. A common man must avoid speculation and stick to the practice of fundamental investment in order to earn and avoid loss.Avoid herd mentality:The decision to buy and sell stocks should not be dependent on acquaintances. Do not tend to invest in stock because people around are also investing in it. Avoid such practices as they do not yield well in long term and often end up with heavy loss.Take research based decisions:Always make sure you research thoroughly before investing in the stock. Since the research gives vital information about market trend. It is not always necessary to go by the company name instead try to look for the performance trend so as to earn better.Invest in a business:Always invest in a business than a stock. This means thoroughly understand the business of the company instead of just looking at the stock value, for better returns. Understanding of companys business will help you to make better decisions.Never time the market:It is always advised by the experts to never time the market. No one ever had been successful in it and you might end up with heavy loss. It is not really possible to catch the top and the bottom prices accurately for any stock because it is always relative.Invest with a disciplined approach:The volatility in the market has often lead to loss even in a bullish trend. Therefore, it is always advised to invest systematically, in the right shares with patience for good returns. Having patience and a disciplined approach always helps in taking the right decisions besides keeping a bigger long term picture.Never let emotions overshadow judgment:The inability to control emotions especially fear and greed has always caused huge loss to the investors. Greed and fear often lead to wrong decisions like creating heavy positions in futures, investing largely in unknown companies. Therefore, it always advised to not let the emotions overshadow the judgment while taking any investment related decisions.Have a broad portfolio:The diversification of portfolio across assets helps in earning optimum returns with minimum risk. The kind and level of diversification depend on the investor.Expect Realistically:Have realistic assumptions. Never expect the stock market to return in the same manner. Unrealistic expectations always lead to wrong decisions and major loss.Invest only surplus funds:An investor should only invest the surplus funds. Since it is a volatile market and always have a risk of loss. Later he can use his gains from the market for further investments.Rigorous monitoring is required:Rigorously monitor to get updated on trends. Even a small event can have a large impact on the stock market. This makes it riskier than other modes and requires more alertness. Thereby demanding rigorous monitoring on events and market.It is always good to increase the scope of income and stock market appears as an option. But with its merit of extra income, there is definitely risk involved. So, one has to be very careful while making investments.

The pricing may vary as per the determination of the relevant date.Currently, the promoters hold 29.8% in the company and the management had indicated in the Q3FY18 conference call that the promoters would like to increase their holding in the company and bring their holding to ~40% level, which would be contingent on promoters liquidity.According to SEBI regulation, the amount equivalent to at least 25% of the consideration based on above pricing methodology is to be paid upon allotment. As per the intended amount of ~Rs600cr, the promoters would then infuse Rs150cr into the company thereby increasing their stake to 31.8% without considering the pending FCCBs of USD19mn (converted to ~1.35cr shares). Upon full conversion of FCCB, the promoters shareholding post initial payment would stand at ~31.1%. Assuming the promoters go for full allotment of ~Rs600cr, their holding post full conversion of FCCBs would improve to 36.3%.Although there will be equity dilution on account of the convertible issuance, the impact on the diluted earnings will be negligible (~2% dilution) on account of sharp reduction in interest cost (decline by 20-23% CAGR over FY17-20E).

This rise has been driven by:Concerns on fiscal deficit and the aftermath of the budgetConcerns on inflation  with inflation rising to 5.2% from a historic low of 1.5% in JuneGlobal rate cycle change & rising yields on global government bondsRise in price of oil and other commodities (chiefly industrial metals)Tighter liquidity conditions as the demonetization related inflows have left the systemAs RBI has a flexible inflation targeting mandate (within a range of 4±2%), inflation remaining in the upper half of the band risks the RBI preemptively raising rates to cool the economy.

The risks listed above have largely been priced in by the market now. Thus without new information, we expect long bond yields to be range bound. However the lack of a negative is not a positive, and even at current levels we do not see value in long bonds given the duration risk involved.Short rates have also sold off in recent months, with the 1-year certificate of deposit now yielding about 7.5% (compared to 6.5% in November). The entire short end of the curve (1-5 years) now appears to have over priced the risk of tight liquidity and RBI policy stance. This is a segment in which we see better value.

This rise has been driven by:Concerns on fiscal deficit and the aftermath of the budgetConcerns on inflation  with inflation rising to 5.2% from a historic low of 1.5% in JuneGlobal rate cycle change & rising yields on global government bondsRise in price of oil and other commodities (chiefly industrial metals)Tighter liquidity conditions as the demonetization related inflows have left the systemAs RBI has a flexible inflation targeting mandate (within a range of 4±2%), inflation remaining in the upper half of the band risks the RBI preemptively raising rates to cool the economy.

The risks listed above have largely been priced in by the market now. Thus without new information, we expect long bond yields to be range bound. However the lack of a negative is not a positive, and even at current levels we do not see value in long bonds given the duration risk involved.Short rates have also sold off in recent months, with the 1-year certificate of deposit now yielding about 7.5% (compared to 6.5% in November). The entire short end of the curve (1-5 years) now appears to have over priced the risk of tight liquidity and RBI policy stance. This is a segment in which we see better value.

It affects over 20% people globally at some point. Studies suggest that approximately 1% of the world?s population may have chronic migraine. While it is a genetic disorder, environment, lifestyle, diet and hormonal imbalances can play a large role in how often you suffer from it.', 'Individuals with migraine can feel completely drained. It can manifest itself as a pulsating or throbbing ache on one or both sides of the head. Patients may also experience nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to sound and light, even pressure on the eyes. Severe migraine can be debilitating, hampering day-to-day functioning. In most cases, the ordeal lasts several days.', 'When it comes to living with migraine, what you eat can make a big difference. Often, patients notice that their migraines are triggered, or symptoms worsened, by the foods they eat. However, the foods or ingredients that can contribute to migraine vary widely.', 'Some people get more migraine attacks after drinking alcohol, especially beer and wine, while others have more frequent migraines if the gap between meals is long. It is worth examining your eating habits to identify patterns that could check the attacks. In some cases, migraine can also be triggered by exposure to sun, stress, lack of sleep, etc.', 'While medication can ease the pain, lifestyle and dietary modifications can also help in relieving and preventing pain. Here are a few things you can do.', 'Isolate and identify the triggers with the help of an ?elimination and challenge? diet. Don?t cut out all your potential trigger foods at once, else you will not be able to find out what your trigger is. This can also lead to stress, which can compound your symptoms.', 'To analyse your triggers, maintain a migraine diary. It will help you keep track of any changes you are making to your diet, and note how severe and frequent your headaches are. For any single food to qualify as a potential trigger, a headache should occur within 24 hours of its consumption. Common triggers include alcohol, artificial sweeteners, caffeine withdrawal, processed meats and foods containing monosodium glutamate, histamines and tyramines found in some aged cheese and chocolates, cured meats, smoked fish, yeast extract and food preservatives that contain nitrates and nitrites. The list is long.', 'Be careful, however, about trying out extremely strict diets. for you may end up avoiding foods that are not necessarily migraine triggers?and you may be missing out on important nutrients in the bargain.', 'If you record at least three attacks caused by a food item, remove it from your diet for a month. If that helps lessen the attacks, abolish it from your diet. Reintroducing a ?trigger? is a good way to confirm that it continues to be one after abstinence, and is therefore worth withdrawing from completely. Strict elimination diets should only be done under medical supervision.', 'Non-dietary triggers such as stress, poor sleep quality and too much sunlight can all exacerbate migraine. Often, it is a combination of all of these factors.', 'Consult a doctor and check whether it would be a good idea to take magnesium supplements. These can help in muscle relaxation and promote sleep.  Also, do get your iron and vitamin D levels checked?if these are low, they can cause headaches.', 'Vishakha Shivdasani is a Mumbai-based medical doctor with a fellowship in nutrition. She specializes in controlling diabetes, cholesterol and obesity.']"

The minister was asked if the government agencies have portrayed a rosy picture on Bt cotton and whether there was a need for a scientific study about the impact of GM crops on health.', '?Bt cotton hybrids have helped to minimise the damages caused by bollworm, reduce pesticide use, increase production, yield and net income of the farmers,? Sharma said. Infestation by bollworm, a major pest of cotton, he said, has had a devastating effect on cotton crop during the late 1990s, with most of the available pesticides becoming ineffective to control it.', 'Bt cotton, which is resistant to bollworm infestation, was released during 2002-03. ?As per the recent data of Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, India has become the largest producer of cotton in the world in the year 2016,? he said.', '?Studies and risk assessment documents prepared by international regulatory agencies and by other countries are also referred for ascertaining the safety of the evaluated product,? the minister said.']"

Finance minister Arun Jaitley termed the scheme Modicare, on the lines of  Obamacare, the universal health insurance plan introduced in the US during Barack Obama?s presidency.', 'Few, however, know that Dr Vinod Kumar Paul, member (health and nutrition) at the country?s apex policy think tank NITI Aayog, led the team that designed the world?s largest government funded financial protection scheme for healthcare that will cover as many as 500 million Indians. In an interview, Dr Paul comments on how the idea for this ambitious programme came about and how the project is going to be implemented in a country that has a dismal record of healthcare delivery. Edited excerpts:', 'What was the ideology behind planning the NHPS? What factors were taken into consideration while charting out this programme?', 'There are basically two pillars of Ayushman Bharat programme under which we are bringing reforms in the healthcare system. One is strengthening our primary healthcare foundation; second is financial health protection for the citizens. The two components of Ayushman Bharat are interlinked. Till now the existing sub-centres are catering to only maternal and child healthcare services but the 1.5 lakh sub-centres that we are converting into wellness centres will cater to majority of services such as detection and treatment of hypertension, diabetes, chronic bronchitis, screening for common cancers, mental health, care of the elderly, eye care, etc. We have added all these things into primary healthcare. Financial health protection is the foundation of any nation?s healthcare policy. Through the National Health Protection Scheme, we will reduce impoverishment due to out of pocket health spending and want to take healthcare in India to the next level by covering the poor and vulnerable 40% of the Indian population by this aspirational model. It is a decisive step toward the goal of universal health coverage.', 'Health insurance schemes in India have seen little success, barring a few states in the south, how do you think this programme is going to fair?', 'First of all, this is not just a health insurance scheme but this is a health assurance scheme for Indians. As health is a state subject, this will be implemented by states and with their own choice. The states will be a custodian of this scheme. Some states can choose an intermediary to implement it such as an insurance company while some may try a trust model in which there will be an autonomous body under the government that will bear all the expenditure. This is a tax-funded scheme.', 'What are the details and timeline of the programme?', 'This scheme is about covering expenses of hospitalization for secondary and tertiary care. In India, out-of-pocket expenditure is over 60% which is one of the highest in the world. Around 6-7 crore people fall into poverty each year due to medical expenses and they are often the non-poor. This one nation, one scheme, will give coverage of Rs5 lakh to 10 crore poor and vulnerable families which means about 50 crore people in India. This will be a cashless, Aadhaar-enabled scheme with 60:40 centre and state share. As far as tentative timeline of the scheme is concerned, the scheme will be finalized after further consultations with state governments, preparation for fraud-proof information system, states? preparation for beneficiary identification, after finalization of guidelines for hospital empanelment and strategic purchase. As soon as the states are ready, the scheme will be rolled out.', 'As projected, the implementation of the programme will require Rs12,000 crore for the first phase for 10 crore families. Do you think the India as one of the economies spending least on healthcare i.e. below 2% of GDP, will able to handle the huge costs involved?', 'As government has given the policy direction, it will fulfil its promise of provisioning adequate funds. I agree that the expenditure on healthcare in India is too less but we have made provisions for a cess that will generate additional\xa0Rs11,000 crore. As envisaged in the National Health Policy, the government will incrementally increase the health expenditure to 2.5% of GDP by 2025. Ayushman Bharat represents the resolve of government to transform the health system in order to ensure that people of India experience good health, live longer, have health lifestyles, and can access quality care without financial hardship if they fall sick. If  finance minister Arun Jaitley has promised to provide adequate funds for Ayushman Bharat, we should believe him. State governments will also increase their health budgets when they join the national scheme.', 'As under the programme, poor and vulnerable people will be entitled to treatment in empaneled central, state government hospitals and selected private hospitals, on what parameters will the private hospitals be selected for empanelment?', 'The hospitals will be chosen on the basis of a structured criteria including optimum facilities, assurance of patient services, accountability and infrastructure for treatment of diseases. We have prepared the framework for this criteria and selection. Selected state and central government hospitals and selected empanelled private hospitals will come in the scheme?s ambit and will serve the beneficiaries. Thus the scheme will be delivered by a network of public and private hospitals. Private hospitals are also nation?s asset.', 'What are the diseases covered this time which have never been covered in any national or state health insurance scheme?', 'The government has already prepared around 1,100 packages for the scheme. There will be certainly several new diseases covered under the new scheme which were earlier not covered under any government health insurance scheme such as dental services, geriatric services and HIV/AIDS etc. We have largely covered almost everything. We hope to cover most of the conditions requiring tertiary and secondary care.', 'As expected almost 40% of Indian population will be covered for free and cashless healthcare with focus on rural India. How will the country that already has a shortage of doctors handle so many patients?', 'For tackling the shortage of doctors, the government has already announced opening of 24 new medical colleges. The workforce will be prepared to serve various hospitals. As the concentration of specialist doctors is more in urban areas, we have plans to give more incentives to doctors who serve in rural areas. We also have various training programmes for nurses and paramedical staff who have long experiences working with senior doctors in tackling common diseases conditions and know the righteous medicines and treatment modalities. Such utilisation of resources will be done until the number of doctors can be increased.', 'Private hospitals have been complaining about delays in payments for treatment provided to patients under government run health insurance scheme ? Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS). How will government ensure to avoid such delays and tussles in the new scheme?', 'We will ensure that such delays and discrepancies don?t happen in NHPS. We will have a proper agency for this purpose to look after smooth flow of money and all the premiums are paid on time.']"

The main worry is due to the disappointing performance of its cash-cow Jaguar Land Rover Ltd (JLR) that has been churning out healthy profits for several years and which churned out 90% to 100% of the consolidated profits.', 'For the quarter, Tata Motors? consolidated net profit of Rs 1,212 crore missedBloomberg?s 15-broker average estimate by a huge 48%. More importantly, its operating profit, although higher than the year-ago period, was also just three-fourths of what the Street had forecast. All this, in spite of a 16% jump in consolidated net revenue on the back of strong sales volumes, especially on the home ground.', 'What this clearly shows is that the costs during the quarter overtook realizations. The glaring miss is JLR?s operating margin of 10.9% against estimates of 11.5%. In fact, fiscal year 2018 has been a challenging one so far, with operating margins in the first and second quarters at 7.9% and 11.8%, respectively, coming lower than forecasts. While the management attributes the sales slowdown to the changeover of some Range Rover models and introduction of new ones, there are other concerns too.', 'Barring China, where sales grew by 14% year-on-year during the quarter, markets in the UK, Europe and North America have been challenging. The investor presentation clearly indicates that the changing trends towards fewer diesel vehicles in Europe and the UK and the trend towards electric vehicles in North America have led to a steep drop in sales in these regions (see chart). Even growth in China has simmered down compared to a few quarters ago.', 'Reiterating this, the management in the conference call said that the cost of responding to higher competition and product changes led to higher variable costs. Along with adverse currency movements, this weighed on profitability.', 'The worry is that the market product cycle uncertainty could see a trend reversal in JLR?s performance, at least in the near term. One can anticipate higher product development costs and depreciation costs with a strain on working capital too for some time ahead, signalling negative free cash flows.', 'Fortunately, the downturn in JLR was partially offset by a recovery in Tata Motors? stand-alone business, as sales of domestic commercial vehicles shot through the roof (see chart) and passenger cars too recovered. Indeed, the company?s turnaround strategy was followed by a recovery in the domestic commercial vehicle market as a whole. Robust sales aided the transition from a loss in the year-ago period to a profit this quarter.', 'However, the stand-alone profit hardly matters except that it prevents a further drain on cash flows.', 'Without doubt, JLR?s poor performance will eclipse the uptrend in domestic business. This is already mirrored in Tata Motors? stock price that has fallen 24% in a year, while shares of its competitor on the home turf?Ashok Leyland Ltd?have risen by 37%. Tata Motors? shares have hugely underperformed even the benchmark indices in FY18 so far and are unlikely to see better days until JLR is on a firm footing once again.']"

The brokerage firm believes that new launches, store expansion and sustained increase in market share will drive sales growth by 22% compound annual growth rate over FY17-20E.', 'It is encouraging that Titan has maintained its jewellery segment revenue growth guidance at 25% for FY18 despite weaker-than- expected numbers for the December quarter. The company?s jewellery business faced a high base, as the festival season in the December 2016 quarter was a strong one with Dussehra and Diwali falling in the same quarter.', 'On a consolidated basis, jewellery revenues rose by 8% year-on-year for the December quarter. This pales in comparison to the 37% growth in the September quarter and a far higher 56% growth in the June quarter. Primary jewellery sales growth was slower, as primary billing was much higher towards the end of the September quarter in anticipation of the festive season.

He noted however that the company had not given a specific estimate of the unspent balances yet.', 'Sources familiar with the development said that RCom had earlier written to Trai arguing against the regulator?s 19 January directive on refunds. In the letter, RCom has cited the Mobile Number Portability Regulations 2009 to highlight that the existing rules mention that the balance amount of talk-time at the time of porting ?shall lapse?.', '?We regret to say that we are unaware of the exact regulation under which a provision exists for refund of balance amount of talk time on a mobile number being ported out for any reason whatsoever...we request authority to withdraw the direction...,? the source said, quoting from RCom?s written representation to Trai.', 'RCom this week wrote another follow up letter to Trai where it has further argued that there is no precedence of customer refunds being sought in several other cases of operators closing down services in the Indian telecom market.', 'On 19 January, the Trai directed RCom and Reliance Telecom (RTL) to refund the unused balance of their prepaid customers and security deposits of their post-paid subscribers and report compliance in the coming weeks.', 'The direction for refund is ?pursuant to closure of 2G/GSM, CDMA services and discontinuation of voice services in all the licensed services areas by Reliance Communications Limited (RCL) and Reliance Telecom Limited?.', 'The move comes at a time when RCom has announced plans to sell its spectrum, towers, optical fibre network and other wireless assets to Reliance Jio, the telecom firm of elder brother Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries.

And yet equity valuations were lower at the time. We are paying through our noses for second-rate growth.', 'That?s because global interest rates are much lower now. For example, the US 10-year government bond yield was higher than 4% for much of 2004 and 2005. Right now, analysts are saying 3% is cause for worry. With the cost of borrowing so cheap, the temptation to take a punt is strong.', 'One reason for low interest rates is low inflation. Even so, real interest rates in the US and other advanced economies are also very low. The yield on the 10-year inflation-indexed security in the US, a gauge of real yields, was around 2% in 2004 and 2005?currently it?s 0.7%. And because interest rates are so low, equity valuations are extended. Even the ultra-conservative Bank for International Settlements, discussing high equity valuations in its December 2017 Quarterly Review, said that while valuations were high, they ?looked far less frothy when compared with bond yields.?', 'The spoiler, of course, could be higher inflation and the January survey of global fund managers by Bank of America-Merrill Lynch pointed to ?inflation and bond crash? as the top tail risk for markets this year. Concerns over higher bond yields have sparked the latest equity sell-off. Inflation in the developed markets is projected to go up a bit this year, but it?s unlikely to be a game changer.', 'There is another factor we have to consider. With so much money in equity funds and exchange traded funds and with the rise of program trading, much depends on how fund flows into equities are affected. If the market continues to drop, redemptions may accelerate. How fund flows pan out will then determine the level at which the market stabilises. That is true both globally and for India, where domestic flows have been very strong in the past year.', 'Much also depends on the central banks in the developed economies and the pace at which they tighten. It is the belief that they will do nothing to spoil the liquidity-fuelled party that ignited the exuberance in the stock markets. So far, developed country central bankers have rushed to soothe the market if it so much as stubbed its toe. But the choice they face is stark: let some air out of the bubble now, or allow it to expand and face a spectacular bust later.']"

You have to hold equity for 1 year, real estate for 2 years and debt for 3 years for the profit made to become ?long term?. This classification of assets is against Finance 101","['Every time people who have defined benefit retirement plans make rules for the market, their lack of understanding comes across clearly. Take people in the Ministry of Finance for instance, and then look at what subsequent Budgets have put in place. Not only is there arbitrage between asset classes on the definition of long term, there is arbitrage within an asset class too on the basis of which product you choose to buy. If tax policy is used to nudge behaviour, there is some serious malfunction in the Indian policy that is nudging in all the wrong directions and all the wrong products.', 'In India we answer the question, ?How many years does it take for an asset to become long-term?? in different ways depending on the asset. You have to hold equity for 1 year, real estate for 2 years and debt for 3 years for the profit made to become ?long term?. This classification of assets is against Finance 101, since both equity and real estate are asset classes that cook slowly over time. They give their best performance over a long period of time. How long is long? Data analysis done by my colleague Kayezad E. Adajania (read ithere) shows that it takes about a 7-year holding period to iron out volatility in equity. The thumb rule for real estate puts the cycle at about 10 years. Market-linked debt (as opposed to relatively fixed-return debt products such as bank deposits) as an asset class for retail investors is mostly used for short-term purposes for emergency funds, for near-term cash needs and for income generation. It would be more logical to make debt go long term at 1 year and keep a 5-year threshold for long term for both equity and real estate. At the very least, policymakers need to equalize the definition of long term across asset classes.', 'Worse, Budget 2018 is nudging investors away from mutual funds and towards equity unit-linked insurance plans (Ulips). The tax on long-term equity is applicable to direct equity and equity-oriented mutual funds, but not on equity-oriented Ulips.  In terms of disclosure, transparency and retail invest friendliness, mutual funds are better than Ulips. For example, the mutual fund expense ratio includes all the costs, but Ulip expense ratio leaves out the mortality costs making the real returns lower. It is unclear why the government would want to direct retail money away from a better product to an inferior one. Why create arbitrage in the way somebody approaches equity?', '', 'Policy changes are slow and convincingbabusthat they don?t understand markets is an uphill task. Meanwhile, what should you do? Two things. One, rethink if you want to be in managed funds and consider shifting fully to exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Remember that managed funds carry ?fund manager risk? or the risk of wrong choices made by the fund manager. Till the time the long-term tax was introduced in equity funds, it was possible to exit from a poor-performing fund to buy a better performing one without a tax implication. Now, however, each time the investor shifts after a year, there is a tax to pay. This will eat into returns in hand post the expense ratios, of an average of 2% per year and the tax. Index funds or ETFs do not carry fund manager risk, since they replicate the index they are benchmarked to. They are also much cheaper, with costs down to 5 basis points in one ETF. As a long-term investor, you will need to do the math on what works for you?riding the ETF and facing lower returns than the managed fund investors or buying into the managed fund and getting your fund choice right.', 'Two, use the window uptill 31  March 2018 to rejig your equity portfolio. Profits made on equity and equity funds have been grandfathered till 31 January 2018. This means that your long-term capital gains as on that day are not taxed. In addition, if you book long-term capital gains, if any till 31March 2018, these will not be taxed. From today till the end of March, you have a window to rework your portfolio without there being a tax liability. Mutual fund portfolios tend to get bloated over time and also tend to get overexposed to a sub-category of funds. A portfolio clean-up is a good annual exercise anyway, but this year it is even more crucial to do the clean up before mid-March. Mid-March because you need time to sell and then buy again the funds that you choose. Choose wisely this time, for the tax on mistakes is now 10.4%.

However, as insurance is a cover for unexpected events; it is going to become more crucial to us especially after the earning phase is over","['The common wisdom is that insurance in retirement is a waste of money. But there are situations where you may need insurance to protect your financial security. The relative importance of different categories of insurance is likely to be different compared to your working years, and it is important to assess your own circumstances carefully to determine your need for insurance in retirement. Here are some circumstances where insurance is recommended.', 'Life insurance may be relevant in retirement if income from a second career forms a significant portion of the retiral income. This is typically the case in the early years of retirement. It is important for the person earning the income to have life insurance, so that the income being earned in retirement is compensated in the event of death. In some cases, the retirement income may be from a pension, which may reduce on the death of the primary pensioner. Life insurance will help replace the lost pension so that the household can continue to manage its expenses. If you have financial responsibility of your children or grandchildren even in retirement, it becomes necessary to have adequate life insurance to meet their needs when you are not there to take care. Again, if you are paying off a large debt in retirement, say a house loan taken late in the earning years, you may consider an insurance policy to the extent of the outstanding loan so that your family is not left with that obligation in the event of your death.', 'Health-related costs have the highest potential to derail your retirement finances. It is good to be prepared for such expenses, even if there are no health concerns at the start of retirement. Make health costs an item you prioritize, when determining the costs to be met in retirement and the corpus you have to accumulate in your working years. Given the uncertainties associated with health and health costs, insurance is an efficient way to meet these expenses in a planned way. However, obtaining health insurance later in life may be difficult and the costs are likely to be higher as you grow older and health issues crop up. One way is to lock yourself into a health insurance policy when you are healthy, so that you are not rejected on grounds of health conditions, or the existing conditions are excluded, or you are charged a prohibitively high premium when you may need insurance. Do this as preparation for retirement even when you are covered by an employer-provided insurance in your working years. Select the insurance policy that takes care of your specific health needs. For example, if there are existing health conditions, then look for policies that have a lower cooling-off or exclusion period, or that may cover pre-existing conditions with lower cooling-off period with a co-payment option. If you need procedures such as dialysis, which require day-stays in hospital, then look for policies that cover multiple hospital admissions of less than 24 hours. Use top-ups and riders to make the most cost-effective and suitable health package for your needs. Personal accident insurance is something you need to consider if you intend to contribute to retirement income, with a second career in retirement. In the event of an accident, such policies compensate you for the period you are unable to work and earn an income, and to meet any out-of-pocket expenses that may not be covered by your broader health insurance policy. Long-term care is another area of old age that falls under the health-needs umbrella. Make sure your corpus provides for the costs associated with providing care and assistance at the stage when you may not be able to take care of all daily-living activities on your own.', 'Life insurance can be a tool for estate planning and managing the costs related to end of life. Life insurance policies can be used as a means to transfer wealth to the next generation, for individuals with a low risk appetite. Premiums are paid through the life of the insured and on their death, the proceeds go to the beneficiaries. Insurance policies allow the person to plan the bequeaths well ahead, accumulate the wealth over a long term and pass on the corpus. There are tax benefits at the time of paying the premiums and the corpus is tax-free too. This boosts the returns from this source, as compared to other investments that are typically used to accumulate wealth for the next generation, such as securities and real estate; where there may be capital gains and other taxes. Remember, life insurance should be part of the overall wealth transfer strategy and should be used in conjunction with other assets. The proceeds from a life insurance policy provide stability and liquidity to the inheritance while the other assets may be illiquid and have volatile values. The effectiveness of using life insurance for inheritance planning will also depend on the cost of the cover. To get the best premiums, it is important to plan ahead and make an early entry into insurance products. Make sure that you don?t overreach. If the premiums are too high for your retirement income to bear, you may not be able to service the policy and lose the benefit for which you have paid for. Another use of life insurance policy is to meet expenses related to care and medical expenses not covered by health insurance at the end of a person?s life. The beneficiaries of the policy will be responsible for meeting these expenses as they arise, and on the death of the person they will be compensated from the proceeds from the policy.', 'You need insurance to protect your assets. This includes auto insurance to compensate for any damage to your vehicle, along with third-party liability coverage to protect you from any claims against you as a result of a motor accident. A third-party liability insurance is essential to ensure that your other assets are not put at risk by a liability claim, and it is also mandatory for motor vehicles. Your home, typically your biggest asset in retirement, requires protection that an insurance policy can provide. The contents of the house can also be insured for a small sum and should be considered to protect against theft, burglary and destruction.', 'Your need for insurance in retirement will be different from the pre-retirement stage and keep evolving through the retirement years. For example, the life insurance policy intended to protect the income for a spouse or to support a loan being paid off is no longer relevant if the spouse passes away or the loan is paid off.', 'Just as you would periodically assess your income needs and make changes to your investments accordingly, you should monitor your insurance needs periodically to ensure that you have the protection you need at the most efficient cost possible.']"

The Moto X4 makes up for the lack of a flagship processor with excellent battery life?the 3,000 mAh battery lasts a day of fairly extensive use, with 45% juice still in the tank in the late evening.

Photographs taken in good lighting conditions come out well detailed and with good colours. Inconsistent lighting can sometimes throw off the contrast a bit, and you?ll see some artefacts too.

BMW claims a 0-100 kmph time of a staggering 3.4 seconds, a good 1 second faster than the older car. Who would have imagined a four-door sedan being capable of these figures? There?s very little lag from the pair of turbos, and you get a brutal, linear shove when you press the throttle.', 'Another big change in the new M5 is the transmission. BMW has ditched the previous car?s dual-clutch unit and gone in for a torque converter?ZF?s eight-speed Steptronic, which has the reputation of being smooth, quick and efficient. The older dual-clutch units can be a bit rough at lower speeds.', 'The only disappointment is the engine sound which, though loud, is a bit underwhelming. It lacks the soulful tone of the Merc AMG V8s and doesn?t burble like a Jaguar either.', 'You appreciate the layer of security the four-wheel drive brings, and the predictable handling goads you to push on a road that?s not much wider than the 1,903mm width of the sedan.

An examination of the fine print suggests that while there may be some upside risks to inflation, fiscal deficit targets look likely to be met.', 'First, the full cost of the health protection scheme that promises Rs5 lakh per household per year appears to be more than what has been budgeted. Second, oil prices may rise while budget estimates seem to assume a scenario of benign oil prices and this may have fiscal implications. Third, the government has announced a 50% increase in minimum support prices (MSP) for the coming kharif crop that could lead to a higher deficit. In addition, the corporate tax rate for small enterprises has been cut to 25%.', 'On the first count, rolling out an all-India health insurance scheme is a challenging task. State capacity to deliver is limited. From the private sector side, good quality tertiary healthcare is still not available all across the country as would be required for this scheme. The supply response of the private sector to the incentives created by this scheme may take some time to realize.', 'In addition, regulatory capacity of, one, the health sector to regulate the private providers, and, two, the health insurance sector to make sure fraud does not become rampant will take time to develop.', 'Further, states need to come on board as well for this scheme. Many of them already have their own insurance schemes and will need to replace old schemes. The transition from old to new schemes may require time. This may mean that the new scheme will have limited expenditure in the current year. The allocation of only Rs2,000 crore suggests that this may indeed be the expectation of the government as well. This may mean that the impact on the deficit of the health insurance scheme may be limited.', 'Oil prices have been rising in recent days. This could put an upward pressure on fuel prices. When global oil prices were falling, the decline in price was not passed on to the consumer as the government increased excise duties. It remains to be seen whether the government will try to keep the price of oil stable. If oil prices rise, would excise be cut to cushion the consumer from the price rise? If so, how would this impact excise collections?', 'Further, the impact of the oil price hike on fertilizer subsidy will be another issue to contend with. The oil price hike would also mean a larger import bill and a higher current account deficit. This could possibly put downward pressure on the rupee.', 'In the past, it has been seen that increase in MSP has led to food inflation. Another channel through which the impact of the MSP hike could be inflationary is through a larger fiscal deficit. There are two possible models through which higher MSP is paid to farmers. One is via actual procurement of foodgrains by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) from farmers, which pays MSP to farmers.', 'However, given that the capacity of FCI to procure all the foodgrains listed across the country is limited, the alternative is to directly pay farmers the difference between market price and MSP. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the scheme benefits traders. In places where this scheme has been tried, it has been found that the difference goes to a large extent into the hands of traders who pay farmers low prices and collude with them to pass on the additional payment to them.', 'This could mean a big payout by the government but not an equal increase in the income of farmers. If ?leakage? arising from this flaw in the scheme could be limited, the deficit could remain under control.', 'In the budget speech of March 2015, the finance minister had promised to bring down the corporate tax rate to 25% over a period of four years. This promise was made on the grounds that the regime of corporate taxes in India needed to be rationalized, exemptions to be removed, and tax rates to be brought down to globally competitive levels. By the end of four years, the corporate tax rate has been cut only for smaller enterprises, which account for roughly less than 10% of corporate tax payments. The remaining corporates will still pay higher taxes.', 'One reason for not going ahead with the reform has been the difficulties in removing exemptions. If the finance minister had gone ahead with reducing the corporate tax rate for all enterprises without removing exemptions, collections would have suffered. While it is a pity that the reform has not been attempted, the effect of the rate cut on the deficit would be limited since only a small share of tax collections will be affected.', 'One clear impact of the budget will be higher personal income tax collections on account of the long-term capital gains tax, dividend distribution tax for mutual funds and the increase in education cess. As the GST (goods and services tax) regime is simplified, we may also see a pickup in GST collections.', 'What does all this mean for inflationary expectations and monetary policy?', 'Over the past one year, the monetary policy committee (MPC) has repeatedly raised concerns about the fiscal deficit. Whenever rates have not been cut despite inflation being around or even below the target of 4%, the MPC has pointed to fiscal slippages and possible higher borrowing due to the Seventh Pay Commission, and higher house rent allowance. Though the MPC may have concerns about the fiscal deficit, if the limited capacity of the government?s delivery mechanisms is taken into account, the MPC should not be overly concerned.

Not a hair out of place, a beatific smile plastered on her face, she has the demeanour of someone who has sold over 2.5 million copies of her first book?one that she self-published before a big publisher picked it up?and which then stayed on theThe New York Timesbest-seller list for over 50 consecutive weeks. Her second volume of poems,The Sun And Her Flowers, published last year, has only cemented the incredible cult around her.', 'It?s not easy to be Rupi Kaur though. ?Readers who have met me for, like, 30 seconds share the most intense story about their lives,? she says. ??My mom died last week and your poems helped me so much!?

Fellow poets like Nayyirah Waheed, who accused her of plagiarism, Lang Leav, Warsan Shire, Atticus and Nikita Gill give her close competition in terms of popularity. (The plagiarism controversy fizzled away, the similarities between their styles were incidental, even inescapable, given their formulaic approach to poetry. ) Then there are the ?haters?, who deplore her writing as an affront to ?real? poetry. Still, it?s not hard to see what makes her tick among her largely millennial audience.', 'Set aside your lofty tastes and read these lines: ?i do not need the kind of love/ that is draining/ i want someone/ who energises me.? Then ask any random sample of users of dating apps what they are looking for. You?ll most likely hear a version of this poem in their answers. Whether they sing it out in Shakespearean cadence or intone it in Rupi Kaur?s glib obviousness, the sentiment is the same. We are all broken. We need love. And some of us would rather hear this from Rupi Kaur than Robert Frost. To each their own.', 'Or sample this: ?i won?t let go cause/ being alone hurts more/ than chasing someone who?s left/ but if you?ve left/ aren?t i already alone/ and surviving it.? Between the visceral directness of this poem and, say, Wendy Cope?s profound witticisms, which one do you imagine will most likely speak to a restless teenager, whose heart is wobbly like Jell-O from a break-up and their body a tsunami of hormones?', 'Has Rupi Kaur, then, liberated poetry from the fetters of snobbery? Yes, if the evidence of her sales is anything to go by. Does her success pose a threat to poetry as we conventionally know it?an elevated, complex and sophisticated mode of expression? Not really. Big trade publishing has long ignored the latter, the appearance of a Rupi Kaur is hardly going to deter them from promoting new and emerging ?serious? poets.', 'Rupi Kaur is pragmatic, even self-protective, regarding the barrage of criticism heaped on her. ?You can?t control what people say about you,? she says. ?Even if I fixed the things they complain about, they will find something else to blame me for.? The problems of being Rupi Kaur are indeed many. She has been slammed for manipulating readers with her outré racial and gender politics?an ?infamous? portrait of her menstruating in bed caused a mini-scandal.

In any case, most insurance schemes do not cover the cost of consultation or medication and are limited to hospitalization and allied expenses.', 'Perhaps the answer lies in companies accepting that the healthcare needs of their employees are their responsibility and building it into the cost of doing business.', 'It isn?t as if the model doesn?t exist.

For example, users tend to click the like button the most because it signals a positive interaction and it is also the default emoticon on Facebook.', '?When we post something on Facebook, our friends tend to click the positive reactions, usually love, haha, or, simply, like, but they?ll seldom click angry,? said Zhang.', 'For social media managers and advertisers, who spend billions buying Facebook advertisements each year, this imbalance may skew their analysis on how their content is actually performing on Facebook, said Dongwon Lee, associate professor at Penn State.', '?This is a step in the direction of creating a model that could tell, for instance, that a Facebook posting with a million likes in fact consists only 80 per cent likes and 20 per cent angry If such a precise understanding on social emotions is possible, that may impact how you advertise,? Lee said.', 'The new model could lead to better analytic packages for social media analysts and researchers. ?A lot of the commercial advertisements on Facebook are driven by likes,? said Lee. ?Eventually, if we can predict these emoticons more accurately using six emoticons, we can build a better model that can discern more precise distribution of emotions in the social platforms with only one emoticon?like?such as on Facebook before 2016,? he said.', 'The researchers trained the model using four Facebook post data sets including public posts from ordinary users, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post, and showed that their solution significantly outperformed existing solutions.

This is where their new ISOCELL Dual technology can help phonemakers, as it offers two  image sensors and an integrated software algorithm which supports depth adjustment and low-light shots.', 'Samsung will club the depth of field algorithm with the 13-megapixel-plus-5-megapixel sensors and the low-light algorithm with two 8-megapixel sensors. This means smartphones with the first set of sensors will allow users to capture images in bokeh and portrait modes. The second set will deliver better low-light shots.', 'The ISOCELL Dual is part of Samsung?s family of new sensors based on their proprietary ISOCELL technology, which works by isolating every individual pixel with a physical wall. This minimises colour crosstalk among pixels, resulting in more accurate colours. This means colours in shots captured with the new image sensor will look more realistic.', 'The other sensors in the family include ISOCELL Bright (combines four pixels into one big pixel and can record multiple exposure to deliver highly detailed shots), ISOCELL Fast (can record Full HD videos at 480fps) and ISOCELL Slim (offers a 24-megapixel sensor with a 0.9 micron pixel size). However, they are likely to be used in mid-range and high-end smartphones.', 'Adoption of dual cameras is no longer limited to high-end smartphones. Xiaomi?s MiA1 (Rs13,999), Honor 7x (Rs12,999) and Moto G5s Plus (Rs14,999) are some of the budget smartphones with dual camera sensors offering features such as depth adjustment, optical zoom, low light and wide field of view. ISOCELL Dual can help drive the adoption of dual cameras in affordable smartphones as phonemakers won?t have to spend time on optimising the software algorithm anymore.', 'Dual camera setup doesn?t always result in better picture quality, but can certainly enhance the camera options for users. Its adoption will also depend on the quality of the sensors and the effectiveness of the software algorithm.', 'Further announcement on phonemakers interested in the technology can be expected at the upcoming  Mobile World Congress 2018 (26 February-1 March).']"

However, American audio brand 1More has managed to tick off both on the design checklist, with the E1001 Triple driver in-ear earphones. These are priced at Rs8,999 and are in direct competition with the popular Sennheiser Momentum In-Ear earphones (around Rs6,990).', 'For starters, the two-tone colour combination of silver and grey exudes a very premium look. As it turns out, the rather smooth texture that one notices while running the finger on the outer surface of each earpiece, is a result of the aluminum alloy body being sand-blasted. The cable that connects the earphones with your phone is reinforced by a material known as Kevlar, which makes it extremely robust and will not break off easily. Quite frankly, we are yet to see any other earphones in this price range with such attention to detail.', 'As the name suggests, the 1More E1001 Triple driver earphones have two balanced armature audio drivers and one dynamic audio driver in each ear?the former pair for clarity of vocals and mid-range frequencies, while the latter for handling bass. As a result, what you get with the E1001 Triple driver earphones is good sound, without any perceptible artificial boosting or tweaking of the audio. That is not all, because these are claimed to be the first-ever earphones to receive the THX certification?this certification means that the sound coming out of audio device is exactly as the audio engineer intended while he was recording and mixing the track. This is surely the standout feature, if ever there was any, in earphones.', 'Most of the time, what you get are detailed vocals without sounding too sharp, and fairly powerful bass and lower frequencies, without sounding hemmed in. If Trance or R&B are your preferred music genres, this will impress undoubtedly, with the vibrant bass. The sound works brilliantly for most music genres, but in some tracks (though not specific to any type of music), we did notice that the mid-range frequencies were not well distinguished. Also, the soundstage isn?t the widest, so you might miss out on some really intricate detailing in music tracks that may have multiple layers intertwined?but the fine reproduction of most elements in a music track more than makes up for that, the rest of the time.', 'The 1More E1001 Triple driver earphones is truly in a tough battle with the Sennheiser Momentum In-Ear earphones (around Rs6,990), and that is where things become a bit more complex?it isn?t easy to choose between the two. While the E1001 Triple driver surely impresses with the overall performance and a wider feature set, the Sennheiser sound is just as good in most cases and can perhaps reproduce the really finer details of a multi-layer music track, a tad better too, but falls behind comparatively on the bass levels. Too close to call, but the E1001 Triple driver is better suited for livelier music, while the Momentums are ideal for more relaxed listening.']"

But within minutes a fierce battle appeared to be playing out between those betting on further declines, and those who thought that the market correction had gone too far, leading to some wild price gyrations.', 'After a swing of nearly 1,200 points during the session, the Dow finished solidly higher, tacking on more than 500 points, or 2.3% from Monday?s close, to 24,912.77. ?The mood on the floor is relief,? said FTN Financial chief economist Chris Low, adding that the Dow?s ?violent? descent on Monday?at one point losing 700 points in a few minutes?would not soon be forgotten.', '?It reminds me of the deep ocean sailors I know,? Low said. ?They love it, but they?re also respectful and terrified.? The steep losses in recent days, as well as the report early Tuesday that the US trade deficit surged 12% in 2017, undercut President Donald Trump?s relentless economic cheerleading, as he has been quick to take credit for every new Wall Street record or data point.', 'Even before an impressive late-session surge, Wall Street?s stronger performance helped the main European stock markets off their worst levels. Still, leading bourses in remained deep in the red at the close, with Paris, Frankfurt and London all down more than two per cent.', 'Earlier, the Nikkei in Japan slumped almost five per cent. Hong Kong lost more than five per cent in its worst day since summer 2015, while Sydney and Singapore each sank three per cent. ?Markets usually grind to the upside, but fall like a rock,? said analyst Naeem Aslam at trading firm ThinkMarkets.', '?Traders have been looking at the market for the past year moving in one direction which was skewed to the upside.

Low agreed that the overall economic outlook remained upbeat, but said investors may see more volatility ahead. And that US fiscal stimulus in an economy at full employment also is fuelling concerns that interest rates will start to rise to stem inflationary pressures.', 'A key question is how new Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell and new voting members of the policy-setting Federal Open Markets Committee will respond if inflation rises significantly. ?There are still a lot of unanswered questions,? Low said. ?There?s no question the economy is just roaring. The big question is what if we overheat? Can this new Fed handle it??']"

Instead, praise the machines?and blame them, too.', 'Last year, Marko Kolanovic, global head of quantitative and derivative research at JPMorgan, estimated that stock pickers?those who trade on stock-specific fundamentals?account for just 10% of today?s stock market trading volumes. Some 60% of trading?twice the share of 10 years ago?is ?passive and quantitative investing.? Nearly half is high-frequency trading by algorithms; though its share is down from the 2009 peak, it?s responsible for pretty much all of the stock market?s volume gains this century.', 'The industry and its regulators have accepted this because the algorithms have been shown to improve market liquidity as they search for speculative opportunities. It?s highly likely, however, that the algorithms?though they?re supposed to do a better job of trading on publicly available information than humans do?have caused the stock market to decouple from important information streams that existed in a human-dominated market. As Thierry Foucault and Sophie Moinas of Toulouse School of Economics wrote in a paper published last month,', 'High frequency traders? ability to quickly extract signals from order flows (trades and price changes) could increase the rate at which informed investors? informational advantage (?alpha?) decays. If this is the case then high frequency trading might reduce the profitability of producing fundamental information and thereby make asset prices less informative about firms? future cash flows in the long run.', 'Indeed, Duke University?s Brian Weller has shown that algorithmic trading deters information acquisition, potentially distorting asset prices and weakening capital allocations.', 'In a sense, thanks to the algorithmic shift, the stock market has become more like the one in bitcoin, also driven largely by algorithmic trading. It?s not that the assets in such markets don?t have a fundamental value?bitcoin does, too, insofar as it allows anonymous transactions that are not transparent to the authorities. It?s just that the fundamental value matters far less than speculative opportunities, which computers, with their superior ability to analyze statistics, can detect better than humans. Relying primarily on information that can lead to short-term gains means, essentially, feeding on what the rest of the market is doing to a greater degree than a human investor does.', 'Existing research is inconclusive on whether algorithmic trading increases volatility: Some recent studies have found that it does, some that it doesn?t. If algos do induce greater price fluctuations, though, there?s a strong ripple effect these days since there?s a large market in volatility-linked instruments?a market that is far removed from stock and economic fundamentals. There are indications that unraveling bets on the volatility index contributed to the current stock market plunge.', 'Trump appears to hold an old-fashioned view of the stock market, linking its performance to investors? expectations about the economy and how companies will do. That explains the White House?s reaction to the stock market drop: Trump?s press secretary, Sara Huckabee Sanders, said the ?president?s focus is on our long-term economic fundamentals.? That?s a good focus for a policymaker to have?but he should also be aware that the stock market is not a good indicator of success or failure. It?s increasingly a thing in itself.', 'That has even bigger implications for ordinary Americans than for Trump. Some 54% of them invest in equities directly, through mutual funds or 401 (k) plans. Shares make up some 35.5% of US households? total financial assets, compared with 20.7% in France and about 11% in the UK and Germany. Americans are more exposed than people in other big, rich nations to a market that, today, is not closely linked to the fundamental value of assets that are traded in it. A significant share of their wealth depends on a somewhat bitcoin-like trading environment.Bloomberg View']"

But he doesn?t get much credit for his investment acumen.', 'SoftBank trades well below the value of its assets, including equity in public companies like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Yahoo Japan Corp. The gap has actually widened in recent months to the point SoftBank?s market capitalization is less than half its holdings, worth at least $180 billion. Indeed, SoftBank?s was little changed in the past year, while its stake in Alibaba alone increased by about $60 billion. The stock rose as much as 5.1% in Tokyo on Wednesday ahead of a quarterly earnings announcement.', 'The discount frustrates executives at SoftBank. They track the changes on a weekly basis and are now planning to step up efforts to close the value gap, according to a person familiar with the matter. They plan to make more transparent how the planned $100 billion Vision Fund will benefit SoftBank and how its start-up investments are valued, said the person, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. Investors are desperate for more clarity.', '?The portfolio has grown too broad,? said Mitsushige Akino, an executive officer with Ichiyoshi Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. ?Son needs to make it clear whether this is a telecommunications company or an investment fund.?', 'Since its founding in 1981, SoftBank has grown from a software wholesaler into a global telecom and investment company. Son, who has said the information revolution is SoftBank?s core business, has used earnings from his telecom operations to fund investments in overseas technology companies. Last year, Son formed the Vision Fund, raising $93 billion from big backers including Saudi Arabia and Apple Inc.', 'Son is already examining one step that could clarify his company?s evolution. SoftBank is considering an initial public offering for its mobile phone unit. That would help draw a distinction between the telecom and investment businesses. Plus an IPO would raise capital and allow SoftBank to move some debt onto the phone unit?s books. ?If anyone doubted the company?s direction, an IPO will clarify that,? said Chris Lane, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.', 'It may also shift SoftBank?s investor base. Lane thinks one reason for the valuation gap is that shareholders are still largely telecom investors who want healthy dividend payouts, which SoftBank doesn?t pay. A mobile phone IPO would allow those investors to get the business?and dividends?they want, while technology investors focused on growth could buy into SoftBank Group and its start-up investments. ?Telco investors shouldn?t be buying this stock, tech investors should be buying it,? he said.', 'A second step Son could take to address the value gap is provide detailed information about the Vision Fund. The billionaire made about 100 investments last year and has stakes in preeminent start-ups, such as Uber Technologies Inc., China?s Didi Chuxing and India?s Flipkart Online Services Pvt. But it?s not always clear when SoftBank cuts a deal itself and when the fund does?and how much of each start-up it owns.', 'Investors also want to know the fund?s fee structure, the company?s valuation of investments and how it tracks gains and losses over time, according to Anthea Lai, aBloombergIntelligence analyst. ?For a conglomerate to narrow a discount, it needs to make it easy to value the subsidiaries,? Lai said. ?And the most difficult one to value is the Vision Fund.?', 'SoftBank is planning to improve disclosure surrounding the Vision Fund when it has its final close, now expected in March, the person said, without detailing all the changes.', 'A third step to address the gap would be selling off more investments. SoftBank?s stake in Alibaba alone is worth about ¥15 trillion ($138 billion), far more than SoftBank?s own market value. SoftBank also took a stake of just less than 5% in chipmaker Nvidia Corp. last year, which would be worth more than $6 billion at current prices. Son needs to be more clear about returns on his investments and when shareholders can expect him to sell assets, Ichiyoshi Asset?s Akino said.', 'Such sales would give Son more money for shareholder returns. The most direct route to narrowing the valuation gap would be to purchase the company?s own stock, according to Atul Goyal, an analyst at Jefferies Group. Buying back even 2% of outstanding shares would send a strong message to the market, Goyal said, though he thinks the likelihood is low.', 'SoftBank?s last buyback was in February 2016, when it announced plans to spend as much as ¥500 billion to acquire about 14% of shares. The stock more doubled over the following 12 months, rebounding from a three-year low.', 'In the meantime, Son is showing no sign of slowing down. Last month, the Vision Fund agreed to invest $300 million in Wag Labs Inc., a start-up that uses a smartphone app to connect dog walkers with dog owners, and led an $865 million investment in Katerra Inc., a construction-technology startup seeking to shake up the building industry.', '?Son is looking for something that can become the new core of the company,? Akino said. ?Many investors continue to believe in him, but they want more clarity on where he is heading. And they don?t want to wait too long.?Bloomberg']"

While the committee is likely to keep the policy rates unchanged, it is expected to highlight the risks to its policy trajectory from rising inflation and higher fiscal slippage.', 'Here are the four things to watch out for in the monetary policy.', 'Rate action:Fourteen of the 15 economists surveyed byMintexpect RBI to keep the repo rate?the rate at which the central bank lends to banks?unchanged at 6%. One economist expects a 25 basis point hike. One basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point. Most economists, however, expect RBI to sound hawkish, hinting at a possible rate hike in FY19. A combination of factors, including rising oil prices, fiscal slippage and impact of higher support price for the farmers, is likely to influence RBI?s policy decision.', 'Inflation:In the December monetary policy, RBI had raised its fiscal second half inflation forecast to 4.3-4.7% from 4.2-4.6%. But retail inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), touched 5.2% in December as vegetable and fuel prices hardened. Rising oil prices, lingering impact of rise in house rent allowance, as part of the 7th Pay Commission, and an expansionary budget are likely to keep future inflation prints elevated. Additionally, some economists are also pricing in potential impact of the budget announcement to allow minimum support price (MSP) of kharif crops 50% higher than the cost of production on inflation. RBI is, therefore, likely to raise the inflation forecast for next year.', 'Growth:In the last policy, FY18 growth projection was kept unchanged at 6.7%. RBI could peg the growth estimate for 2018-19 at 7-7.5%. Most research houses are penciling a strong recovery beginning in the fourth quarter. Non-food bank credit increased by 10% in December as compared with 4% growth in the same period last year. Recapitalisation of public sector banks may help improve credit flows further.', 'Comments on domestic fiscal situation:The government revised the fiscal deficit target for FY18 to 3.5% of the GDP and FY19 to 3.3%. Economists expect an upside risks to fiscal deficit next year, given the ambitious growth projection on tax revenue and higher government spending ahead of elections. Rising oil prices could also add to the fiscal deficit burden, resulting in higher government borrowing. RBI?s statement on fiscal deficit will, therefore, be keenly watched.']"

It has even made higher provisions every quarter and lifted its provision coverage ratio to a little over 60% from 55% a year ago.', 'In other words, the bank has not only put its house in order but has also built enough insurance to protect against future risks.', 'But these are perhaps the only numbers that look good for the bank. It pays to look at the details. PNB saw its stock of gross bad loans slip 0.2% sequentially and 3.4% from a year ago. But then, it wrote off Rs6,128 crore worth of loans during the quarter, a 62% jump in a single quarter. Its upgrades were a mere Rs1,286 crore while fresh slippages were Rs11,204 crore.', 'Essentially, PNB saw its bad loan stock fall not because errant borrowers began repaying loans but because they went so bad that it had to write them off. Also, the rate at which fresh errant borrowers are emerging has not abated.', 'What saved face was the 31% rise in cash recoveries.', 'PNB?s stressed asset pile is still a formidable Rs67,129 crore or 14.13%. The bank also has an aggregate exposure of over Rs18,000 crore to the 29 borrowers out of 40 accounts listed by the Reserve Bank of India, most involved in court proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. It still has to provide Rs1,150 crore towards these accounts.', 'While these problems persist, the lender also has a hostile environment emerging from the bond market. For the December quarter, the bank had to provide Rs1,075 crore towards a mark-to-market hit on its investment portfolio, seven times that in the corresponding quarter in the previous year. Bond yields have risen further since December and are unlikely to go lower any time soon.', 'The challenge to rein in bad loans is still there and unfriendly markets are adding to the difficulty for the lender.', 'In light of this, the 6.9% increase in core income and 11.1% rise in net profit look weak.

The one statement about its US business that kindles some hope is that price erosion is continuing but is beginning to level out.', 'Its management said leading generic firms are reaching a pain point and may increase prices or exit unviable products. This is consequent to unceasing price cuts extracted by the distribution channel, which has become powerful every year on the back of continuing consolidation. With more consolidation seeming less likely, the hope is that prices will at the minimum stabilize.', 'Lupin?s US business did not do too badly during the quarter but all eyes were drawn to the 65% decline in its net profit over a year ago and 51% fall sequentially. That was way more than what analysts had estimated and sent its shares plunging by 6% on Tuesday. The company blamed one-off factors. Adverse foreign exchange fluctuation caused a hit of Rs 82crore. In some quarters, this contributes to profit and in others, it causes a loss. This quarter saw both a loss and of a higher quantum. Secondly, a change in the US tax law resulted in a charge of Rs36 crore, which added to its tax liability.', 'But this was not all. Lupin?s gross profit?the profit remaining after deducting material cost from sales?declined as a percentage of sales. The decline was seen both over a year ago and sequentially. Since the US business grew sequentially, one would have thought that the margin should also have improved. Apart from the forex loss, part of which reflected here, the company said the mix could have played a role, as India?s contribution rose. But it also said that this gross margin could be considered as a base for now.', 'A lowered gross margin leaves a lower percentage to meet its other operating expenses. No wonder then that Lupin is tightening its belt, with employee costs declining and other expenses falling over a year ago. However, other expenses rose significantly sequentially, which the company mainly attributed to the forex losses that reflected here. They should, therefore, settle in the forthcoming quarters.', 'In the near term, Lupin is expecting that new launches in the US market will help it arrest price erosion and grow sales, with the focus on Solosec, a product added to its pipeline after a recent acquisition. In the longer run, investor attention will remain on the company?s ability to resolve the warning letter received for two plants. That will take time and is uncertain.', 'Lupin?s management said it is refocusing its research expenditure for the US market, giving priority to products where it can be among the top three and not pursue others. That will conserve its research spends, which are already relatively high at 12.2% of sales. That?s a pragmatic approach given the difficult market conditions in the US.', 'In the near term, Lupin needs the US market to remain stable and for a steady drip of new products from its pipeline that can contribute to higher sales growth.

Driving this was the 16% growth in domestic two-wheeler sales, but without an expansion in realizations, which indicates competitive pressures in the two-wheeler market.', 'Moreover, the auto industry has been faced with rising raw material costs. Hero?s raw material costs rose in absolute terms steeply when compared to a year back. They rose by 250 basis points as a percentage to sales in spite of higher volumes clocked and the benefits of operating leverage.', 'This dragged the operating margin down by 100 basis points year-on-year to 15.9%, although it was what the Street had expected. The quarter?s operating profit grew by 7.3% to Rs1,158 crore. Mark-to-market losses on the investment portfolio, however, translated into lower other income, which in turn impacted net profit growth. The Rs805 crore net profit therefore was a tad lower than forecasts and 4.3% higher year-on-year.', 'Hero?s shares fell by 2.5% on Tuesday, which was largely due to the fall in the overall market. Otherwise, it is on a better wicket both in terms of growth and valuation among two-wheeler makers. While Bajaj Auto Ltd?s shares trade at about 20 times one- year forward earnings, TVS Motor Co. Ltd?s trade at 32 times. Hero is comparatively cheap at about 18 times. According to Bharat Gianani, research analyst at Sharekhan Ltd, ?Rising rural demand and strong budgetary focus on rural spend will boost motorcycle sales. So, FY2019 is likely to witness another year of double-digit growth in two-wheelers.

Given the uptick seen in inflation, it was a prudent decision. A bigger challenge for RBI will be navigating through the next financial year. Higher yields, inflation and election cycle in the US and India are likely to lead to an increase in financial volatility in global and Indian asset markets and make RBI?s task increasingly difficult.', 'While there are challenges, India?s growth outlook is looking better than ever. The government?s move to recapitalize public sector banks (PSBs) will ensue that credit is available for productive activities, in particular to micro, small and medium enterprises.', 'The capital allocation has also been thought through as banks under RBI?s prompt corrective action have been given higher allocation so as to ensure that they will be in a position to lend and grow. Moreover, government?s planned spending on roads, affordable housing and railways along with pick-up in exports will ensure that economic growth improves to 7.5% in 2018-19 from 6.5% in 2017-18.\xa0Will this growth be inflationary? This will be the biggest factor deciding RBI?s rate trajectory. As of now, the industrial sector is sitting on excess capacity. Even as growth outlook is improving, the private sector is still not looking at expanding capacity. According to CMIE data, capital formation in the country has increased only by higher government orders which now form 55% of outstanding order book compared to 45%, a few years ago. Investment in real estate is also weak as households are increasingly investing in financial assets such as mutual funds instead of housing. As a result, even as the gap between potential and actual output narrows, there may not be a generalized pressure on inflation.', 'Inflation data for now corroborates this. The recent increase in inflation is driven by vegetables and housing. If we exclude the above two (including pulses which is deflating the index), CPI inflation has averaged 4.2% during April-December 2017 compared with 4.9% in FY17 and 4.5% in FY16. This has been achieved despite oil prices doubling in the last two years. In addition, global food prices have not yet seen a pass-through of higher energy prices.\xa0However, pressure on food inflation may increase. The government reiterated its stand on doubling farm incomes by 2022 in the Union budget. For the same, the government is looking at ensuring that farmers are remunerated adequately. Food subsidy to Food Corp. of India has been increased by Rs36,000 crore in the budget.', 'Higher oil prices will not only add to inflation but also put pressure on government?s fiscal arithmetic and consumption. The decline in the last few days if sustains will be helpful. Higher oil prices imply that households will allocate larger share of wallet to cooking and transport fuels thus substituting demand for other goods. Lower consumption also implies lower indirect tax collections. The government may look at reducing taxes on transport fuels to cushion the impact on retail prices which implies risk of fiscal slippage (as seen in FY18).', 'In addition, India?s trade deficit as well as current account deficit will also expand. Oil imports have already increased to $76 billion in the first nine months of this financial year compared with $61 billion in the same period last year.', 'Monthly oil imports are now at $10 billion a month ($7.5 billion in FY17). India?s current account deficit is likely to expand to 2.2% of GDP in 2017-18 from 0.7% in 2016-17. Even with a rising trade deficit, the rupee has been appreciating on the back of weaker US currency. A global risk-off may change the trend.', 'The balance of risks points to higher rather than lower inflation. Rising bond yields are also pointing to a pick-up in growth and inflation. The bond market is anticipating RBI to tighten monetary policy sooner than later. However, given that India continues to maintain positive real rates, RBI need not move in a hurry and has enough room to wait. Even as we see RBI holding rates on Wednesday, MPC members will sound extremely cautious and chart out the risks on the inflation front. A sharper-than-expected rise in international oil prices may change the thesis. Otherwise, we foresee a pause by RBI in 2018.', 'Sameer Narang is chief economist at Bank of Baroda.']"

Individuals accounted for the highest proportion of long-term gains declared in two out of the four years for which income tax numbers are available. Companies come out on top for the other two years.', 'Companies accounted for 49.19% of long-term capital gains in the latest year available which is financial year 2014-15 (corresponding to assessment year 2015-16).

They account for 90% of the total number of entities who mention long-term capital gains in their income tax returns. Other categories such as company, Hindu undivided family, firm, association of persons (AOP) or a body of individuals (BOI) and others account for the remaining. Less than 1% of the tax returns filed mention long-term capital gains across the years.', 'The caveat to this is that the data includes all kinds of long-term capital gains: transactions on property, bullion and others. The government has not released more granular data. It would be interesting to see if the trend is significantly different if one considers long-term capital gains on only listed securities. Individuals, for example, have a significant proportion of their savings in physical assets like real estate and gold.', 'Even if individuals have to bear a significant portion of the new capital gains tax, it is no reason why it should not be imposed in India. In fact, it has been observed that India has an especially liberal taxation policy on capital gains after long-term gains were made tax-free in the 2004 budget.', '?The paper finds that capital gains tax on securities is very liberal in India... Distinction between capital gains on the basis of holding period and exemption of long-term capital gains, coupled with a low flat tax rate of 15% on short-term capital gains, is resulting in severe revenue implications for the exchequer in India,? said a May 2016 paper entitledRevisiting Capital Gains Tax on Securities in India,authored by Prashant Prakash, Jaya Kumari Pandey and Abhishek K. Chintu, published in theEconomic & Political Weekly.', 'The paper referenced a method to calculate long-term capital gains tax (Amaresh Bagchi?s paperRethinking Tax Treatment of Capital Gains from Securities,published in 2007). It used regulatory data about the value of delivery-based transactions during a given year to calculate the amount of long-term capital gains that might have been generated.Mintreplicated this methodology using data from theSecurities and Exchange Board of India?s Handbook of Statistics.', 'Calculations show that the government has missed out an annual average figure of over Rs32,000 crore in long-term capital gains over the last 10 years, based on a 10% tax rate.This is higher than the Rs20,000 crore mentioned in the budget speech.', 'The methodology does not account for the exemption on gains up to Rs1 lakh which has been made available in the latest budget due to lack of data on individual gains. Tax data was also not sufficiently granular to calculate how much of the long-term capital gains declared may have been below this threshold.', '', 'There is a direct correlation between market movement and long-term capital gains. There are peaks seen during the bull run preceding the global financial crisis. Similar gains are seen when the markets rose after the Narendra Modi government came to power. This may also mean that a crash in markets would erode collections.', 'The caveat to this is that the methodology considers that investors held half the delivered shares for more than a year. It also assumes that the capital gains realized on the same were not more than 50% of the final selling price. Differences in the proportion of delivered shares which have been held for more than a year, and the degree of their gains may alter the arithmetic. However, it does give an estimate which is useful until more granular data is made available.', 'The gains through the new tax would be important at a time the Modi government has been struggling with meeting fiscal targets. The fiscal deficit has been targeted at 3.3% of the gross domestic product (GDP) for 2018-19. This is higher than the earlier target of 3%. The new tax would help reduce the deficit by 0.1% of GDP, based on the government?s expected collection of Rs20,000 crore.', 'A little extra tax from the average stock market investor may not be asking for too much at such a time, though the government could consider providing indexation benefits and removal of securities transaction tax to soften the blow.']"

In an interview, Ayukawa comments on the challenges he faces, the continuing dominance of Maruti and whether that is a result of stronger fundamentals or weak rivals. Edited excerpts:', 'Under your stint, Maruti has strengthened all the verticals, signs of which are visible in your earnings and market share. But, the company still seems to be weak on the technology front amid changing industry dynamics.', 'You say you have some concern about the technology development in the company. But, if we cannot do, we cannot survive. We have to do something to catch up with the requirement and demand of customers.', 'What is it that the consumers want in the next five to seven years?', 'Customers demand is changing very fast. Any time, they want an affordable and good product... that is a basic. With the economic situation in the country changing, minds of customers are also changing. We have to find out what they are expecting. But affordability continues to be a very important aspect. That remains the bottom line of the Indian market.', 'Will it be possible to maintain this kind of pricing level amid changes in emission norms, safety norms, which will increase cost?', 'Obviously, with new regulations, we will have new technology, which will increase costs. That could be very challenging. How we are going to compensate for that is another challenge for us any time. But, everybody is facing the same difficulty.', 'If the prices go up, will buyers postpone their purchase decisions?', 'That is a concern for everybody. If we add additional cost to the price... practically it is very difficult for the customers to accept that.', 'Indian industry has a tagline?small is beautiful. Do you think that will stay?', 'I believe so. People understand that there is no need to spend additional money for a bigger car. Small is beautiful and good enough for a product.', 'Will you be able to maintain your market share?', 'We will try to maintain our market share. Nobody wants to see any reduction in volumes and we are not much concerned about the target of maintaining the market share. We try to expand our business across the country. Hence, eventually or fortunately we are getting additional market share.', 'Maruti is the only company that is growing in the country. What differentiates you?', 'As far as Maruti is concerned, the company is looking at the Indian market first. That?s why we always develop products that the Indian customers want and that is very important. Other players are looking at other markets as well. They bring products which are suitable to other markets, here... That is one of the differences, I believe. We are based here and should manufacture products which will match the Indian customer demand. That is a very important point. If you think why Maruti Suzuki has been successful?that has been a key point. That?s why everyday we are focusing on the change in the Indian customer?s expectation two or five years down the line.', 'So, what is the reason for the success of Maruti? A stronger Maruti or a weaker competition.', 'I don?t know about the competitor but the thing that we must do is to match the market and that?s why our products will be accepted by the customers, in terms of price quality and features. Also the customers select us because of the network as well. Our network is stronger than others and any given place they can find our dealer. Even if some problem crops up it can be easily repaired.', 'What are the challenges that Maruti could face in the next 7-10 years?', 'Right now the automobile industry globally is facing a lot of challenges. How it will turn out and whether we will be able to survive or not will be decided after 10-15 years and that is a very critical time, I believe. Everyone is facing the same difficulty, not only us, but also Toyota, Volkswagen and General Motors, etc. Also new players and new entrepreneurs are coming in the industry in different times. Mechanically producing a vehicle is not easy, it?s not like a computer. Also there are safety concerns associated with a vehicle. If there is some safety-related problem, then it cannot be easily modified like a computer. You cannot just try to fix it and keep the data somewhere else. Cars cannot be repaired in such a way.', 'Have you noticed a change in the attitude of first-time buyers? They seem to be moving towards higher priced products.', 'Simply looking at the model-wise sales, still Alto is number one! Other bigger size vehicles are becoming popular and the first time customers are directly buying the Dzire, Swift or the Baleno. Still there are customers who prefer small cars and we have to take care of those people. Some customers are directly buying the Swift or the Dzire but some are upgrading from Alto, Wagon R to Swift and Dzire or Ciaz. We have these kind of customers and have to take care of them. That is an important point. We have to cover a lot of customers under the Maruti umbrella and that is very important for our industry. Some customers upgrade from motorcycles to a used car and then try to buy a new car. So we have to comprehensively take care of our customers. That?s why we need a small car and a good car and then the second step, third step and so on. That is our strategy.', '']"

The latest in this is the gallery?sIndia?s French Connection: Indian Artists in Franceat the Visual Arts Gallery in the India Habitat Centre in New Delhi. Running from 1-11 February, this compact and visually stunning exhibition of 25 Indian artists features a selection of modern masters like Amrita Sher-Gil, Jogen Chowdhury, SH Raza, Sakti Burman and Ram Kumar, among others. The artists? engagements with Paris was varied, from long sojourns to brief dalliances. However, the artworks presented here distil those engagements into highly individual statements.', 'A very interesting facet of the selections is the way they capture unique moments in the careers of the artists. For instance, Ram Kumar?s 1963 oil on canvas work of a city waterfront calledUntitled, is a snapshot of a moment of transition for the Bombay Progressive Artists? Group luminary. His stylistic progression from figuration to abstraction is well known, and this painting captures the artist in the middle of making that move. This is juxtaposed brilliantly with another untitled work from 1961, which is a pure meditation on colour.', 'Others, like two of Sakti Burman?s paintings from the early 70?s, capture a moment when the artist?s style was still evolving. His 1975 oil on canvas,The Wait, is a large, marvellous work that exudes a surreal, fey quality, with its depicted human and animal figures existing in some wonderland of the mind. The marbling effect that he?s known for is in evidence in the fresco-like treatment of his works here. Jehangir Sabavala?s 1950 oil on canvas painting,Still-Life with Apples, is a lyrical impressionistic piece from an artist known more for his cubist works.', '', 'There are three sculptures featured in the exhibition, including a bronze piece by Prodosh Dasgupta from 1990 calledQueen Reclining. It recalls European pre-historic sculptures of female ?mother earth? figurines with its small breasts and a large lower body. The piece also plays with perspective, creating an effect of languor and ease.', 'Amrita Sher-Gil was the first of the exhibited artists to go to Paris, where she trained under the French painter Lucien Simon at the École Nationale des Beaux-Arts. Her warm and peaceful oil on canvas painting,View from Studio(1934) is a clear example of taking what she learnt of the European masters and using it to create something original.', 'With the riches on display,India?s French Connectionrewards the viewer for time spent at the exhibition. Designed by French scenographer Adrian Gardère, each individual artists? works has been afforded a lot of breathing space at the show, with about 3 works exhibited per artist. DAG has also published a satisfyingly lavish book to go with the exhibition, which contains many more works which couldn?t be accommodated in the Visual Arts Gallery. DAG?s CEO Ashish Anand considers this to be the best show that the gallery has ever put together. ?Each work has been very carefully chosen. It looks better, and we could better contain everything,? Anand says. In a short film made for the exhibiton, art historian Dr. Devika Singh stresses that for the artists, ?Paris is not so much a place of imitation, as a place of experimentation. They come here and what they find is their personal voice.?', '', 'DAG is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year, andIndia?s French Connectionkicks off a week of intense art-related events from the gallery, including talks by Bernard Ruiz-Picasso, the co-founder of the Museo Picasso Málaga (7 February); Jean-Marc Bustamante, Principal of the École Nationale des Beaux-Arts (8 February) and Catherine Chevillot, Director of the Rodin Museum in Paris (10 February). You can watch these talks live on DAG?s Facebook page. Also look out for DAG?s exhibitionNavratna: India?s National Treasure Artistsat the gallery?s booth at the India Art Fair.

A global slump in fixed-income trading has weighed on fees, with the end of the China M&A boom delivering an added Asian drag.', 'What investment banks needed was good old-fashioned uncertainty, and this week?s stock market tumble seems to have delivered that. FICC, or fixed income, currency and commodities trading, has typically been the main driver of banks? revenue. Placid or ever-rising markets are no good for this business, as the Coalition numbers show: FICC revenue fell to $22 billion for Western investment banks in the region, from $23.8 billion in 2016.', 'The equity rout and the jump in the Cboe Volatility Index?better known as the VIX?provide early signs that this year will be different. That?s good news for hedge funds, which have been sidelined, and the investment banks like Goldman that rely on them.', 'While higher interest rates should spell the end of a boom in dollar bond sales, there are reasons for optimism. China shows few signs of easing up on its deleveraging campaign, which means onshore debt issuance will remain tough. As a result, Chinese issuers, especially property companies, will keep tapping the offshore market. Debt capital markets issuance in the region rose to a record last year and has regularly set highs since surpassing $100 billion in 2009.', 'Even for equities, emerging from Wall Street?s biggest tumble in six years, all is not lost. While falling markets will drag down volumes, a wall of Chinese money has made its presence felt in Hong Kong in the past few years. There was record mainland buying of Hong Kong-listed stocks through the trading pipes connecting to the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges on Monday.', 'Chinese government crackdowns on wealth-management products and, most recently, bitcoin trading platforms, have narrowed the investment options available to the local population, increasing the allure of Hong Kong stocks. Investment banks that are capturing flows through the stock and bond connect programs have strong prospects even as the MiFID II regulations hurt their business.', 'There are some clouds. The clampdown on China?s outbound M&A remains in place, though the type of purchases coveted by Beijing?think semiconductor acquisitions and Belt and Road-related projects?have a better chance of winning approval, provided they aren?t blocked by overseas regulators.', 'But if the omens are correct, the familiar ritual of job cuts at Asian investment banking operations may finally be a thing of the past.

The Budget says that after 1 April 2018, the LTCG earned from investments in equity will be taxed at 10%. However, any LTCG earned till 31 January 2018 will be grandfathered, which would mean that LTCG earned before 31 January will not be taxed.', 'This move may prompt some investors to rejig their portfolios. There is some good news for them. On 4 February 2018, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) released a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs) about the proposed tax on LTCG (read here:incometaxindia.gov.in/News/FAQ-on-LTCG.pdf). It says that the tax on LTCG would not be applicable on transfers (of equity investments) that are made between 1 February 2018 and 31 March 2018. Read more about the proposed rule and its tax implications.', 'The new LTCG tax will be applicable to transfers made on or after 1 April 2018. Transfers between 1 February 2018 and 31 March 2018 will be eligible for exemption, as they are now under clause (38) of section 10 of the Income-Tax Act, 1961. So, if you sell these shares or mutual fund units before 31 March 2018, the date 31 January 2018 does not matter to you. Any gains in such cases will be taxed according to the current tax regime.', 'If you sell or exit an equity investment within 1 year of its purchase, gains will be considered short term capital gains and taxed at 15.45% including cess. If you sell it after a year of holding, any gains from the transfer or sale will be considered LTCG and no tax will be applicable.', 'So, if the price of a share has risen significantly after 31 January, and you have held it for over a year, it would be more tax efficient to sell it before 31 March and buy it back?if you want to stay invested in it.', 'However, if you find that the price of your equity investment has gone down after 31 January, but the long-term prospect of the investment is intact and you want to hold on to it, you should not sell the share, as there would be no tax benefit in selling it and buying it back.', 'The date of 31 January 2018 comes into play only when the investment you hold was purchased before 31 January and you sell it after 1 April 2018.', 'In this case, to calculate the gains, one has to know the fair market value (FMV) of that equity investment as on 31 January 2018. FMV means the highest price of such share or unit quoted on a recognized stock exchange. If there was no trading in the particular stock on 31 January 2018, FMV will be the highest price quoted on the date immediately preceding 31 January 2018, on which it was traded.', 'When you sell an equity investment after 1 April 2018, assuming it was bought before 31 January 2018, you need to calculate the capital gains based on its cost of acquisition. Cost of acquisition is higher of the purchase price or the FMV on 31 January 2018 (for these shares or mutual fund units).', 'Let?s take an example: Say you bought a share for Rs100 on 1 January 2015 and its price on 31 January 2018 was Rs300. In this case the cost of acquisition for calculating capital gain would be Rs300, as this is higher of its purchase price (Rs100) and its price as on 31 January (Rs300). If the shares? price was Rs50 on 31 January 2018, then the cost of acquisition would be taken as Rs100, again higher of purchase price (Rs100) and price as on 31 January 2018 (Rs50).', 'The difference between selling price and the cost of acquisition would be the capital gain or loss. If there is gain, it will be taxed at 10.4% including cess. In case of long-term capital loss, it will be allowed to be set-off and carried forward in accordance with existing provisions of the income-tax Act. Thus, it can be set-off against any other LTCG and any un-absorbed loss can be carried forward to subsequent 8 years for set-off against LTCGs.']"

The rules for determination of residential status under the exchange control law are different from those under the income-tax law. Under the income-tax law, residential status is determined on the basis of physical presence in India. Interest income from resident savings bank account and NRO savings bank account is taxable at the same slab rate. Also, interest income from savings bank account (either resident or NRO) is eligible for deduction from taxable interest income up to Rs10,000. However, withholding tax provisions are applicable in case of NRO savings bank account.', 'Under the income-tax law, interest income from savings bank account paid to a ?Resident? (residential status as determined under the income-tax law) is not liable for withholding tax. Accordingly, banks do not withhold income-tax at the time of payment of interest income from resident savings bank account. In case of resident fixed deposits, banks are required to withhold tax at 10% if the total interest income exceeds Rs10,000. However, once the resident bank account is designated as NRO bank account, the withholding tax provisions on amount paid to a non-resident is triggered as any payment made to non-resident is liable for withholding tax. Accordingly, banks withhold income-tax at 30% (plus surcharge, if applicable and education cess) on interest income paid to non-residents.', 'In your case, bank is withholding income-tax as your account is an NRO savings bank account and you likely qualify as non-resident in India under the India income-tax law. However, as discussed above, the taxability of interest income from resident savings bank account and NRO savings bank account is same.', 'The said withheld tax may be claimed as an income-tax refund in your India income-tax return in case your total taxable income, after claiming the permissible deductions, is below the maximum amount not chargeable to tax (Rs2.5 lakh for financial year 2017-18).', 'In case of double taxation, applicable benefits under the relevant Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement may be explored.', 'What is a Tax Residence Certificate?

But how will this movement impact your investments?","['With both the Union Budget and Monetary Policy now behind us, there is a lot of uncertainty in bond markets where the benchmark 10-year g-sec yield has remained elevated, signalling negative sentiment and risk.', 'Some negative news is priced in already. Budget-day reaction saw the benchmark 10-year g-sec yield move up to levels of around 7.86% in intra-day trade. Bond prices fall when yields move up, signalling bad news or negative sentiment. The benchmark yield is currently about 7.50%.', 'The monetary policy has left rates unchanged and maintained a neutral stance. While 5 of the 6 monetary policy committee members voted for no change in rates, one voted for a 25 basis point increase in policy rate. This itself signals concerns on inflationary pressures, which the bond market has been pricing in. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its monetary policy commentary has now raised its inflation estimate for Q4 and for the first half of the next financial year to above 5%. It?s uncertain whether this itself will trigger a rate hike. However, what?s clear is that bond yields are likely to remain elevated for now. One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point.', 'All this activity around rising bond yields has implications not only for your debt allocation but also the equity market too. Should you be worried? Globally too sovereign bond yields have moved higher, triggering a sharp sell-off in equity markets across the globe.', '', 'There is more than one factor behind the confusion and selling in the domestic bond market. It is a combination of fundamental factors that have turned negative, coupled with excess supply of g-secs that is causing the yield to remain high.\xa0According to Ajay Manglunia, co-head, fixed income advisory, Edelweiss Financial Services, ?With crude oil prices moving up last year, there is concern that inflation may rise and there is no certainty where crude prices may pause. Second, in the US, it is expected that rate hikes will be more aggressive this year. Bond traders are already sitting on losses and have no appetite to buy more in this market environment.?', 'Crude oil prices touched a high of around $70 per barrel (Brent Crude), up from around $45  in July 2017. This fast-paced rise in crude prices has been a cause for concern as India imports around 70% of its crude oil requirement, and higher prices are not only going to increase the import bill but also fuel price rise in other goods and services that use fuel.', 'While there is no certain way to predict how crude oil prices will move, the other two components?domestic inflation and supply side issues?may be easier to resolve.', 'According to Shankar Raman, head-third party products and investment advisory, Centrum Capital Ltd: ?Bond markets can get a positive surprise if Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenues stabilises in the coming months and food price-based inflation is managed well through supply management, implementation of direct debit for farmers and minimising crop wastage. On the technical side, the bond supply issue could be tackled by making available a defined block of Indian (government) securities for foreign institutional investors.?', 'Bond markets are nervous right now. How yields move in the coming weeks will depend a lot how change in inflation data impacts RBI?s neutral stance going forward. If inflation moves significantly above RBI?s estimated 5.1% level, then it may have to shift focus to managing inflation over growth, which will be a substantial risk for bond markets.', 'In December 2017,MintMoney had cautioned that investors in various fixed-income securities needed to lower their return expectations (read ithere).', 'Despite rising yields, corporate bonds are not seeing much transactional activity; hence debt fund accrual yields haven?t benefitted yet.', 'According to Manglunia, ?For g-secs, the supply is constant and yields have been rising, but activity on the corporate bond side is subdued. Corporates are not ready to accept that these rates will sustain and prefer to wait and watch before coming to the market. Moreover, the gap in yield?between market borrowing and bank borrowing?is lower now, making the latter a preferred choice at the moment.?', 'Dynamic bond funds are already seeing a shift towards lower duration. Median duration in the dynamic bond category had dropped from 5.79 years in June 2017 to 4.37 years at the end of December 2017 and is expected to be even lower for the January-end portfolios. This potentially reduces marked-to-market risk and makes returns less volatile, at least for the time being.', 'On the deposit side, private banks had already hiked their base rates by 5-10 basis points in January this year, signalling a marginal increase in deposit rates.\xa0A trend confirmed by senior bankers speaking atMint?s Annual Banking Conference that took place on 6 February 2018.', 'Given this yield move in the 10 year g-sec of over 100 basis points in 6 months, is there a contrary opportunity to buy into this correction in the bond market?', 'This is unlikely as trading losses are already present and market participants are wary of taking fresh positions. Retail investors in any case need to stay away from such short-term opportunistic moves as timing an entry and exit is not easy for them. For your strategic medium-term debt allocation, short-term bond funds are still the most appropriate tool on a 3-year post-tax basis.', 'The negative sentiment in the bond market has now spilled over to equities too. The biggest impact can come from inflationary expectations. According to Nishant Agrawal, head - advisory family office, ASK Wealth Management, ?Stock prices were overvalued and these negative macro factors coming together have meant that the long-awaited correction is a reality now. While inflation is a worry now, in the medium- to long-term, it is unlikely to impact the stock market negatively.?', 'If rates were to go up,  it will also have a negative impact on corporate margins and earnings expectations will start to get lowered. This in turn will affect the expectation on equity-market returns negatively.\xa0Last, with global quantitative easing getting reversed gradually, the liquidity-driven rally in global equity markets is expected to slowdown its pace. Higher bond yields will also see a share of institutional money getting shifted out of equity. All this will have an impact of slowing down the pace of equity market returns for the time being.', 'Be ready for the risk, and hence volatility in equity returns, but don?t shift your long-term equity allocation. This remains an asset class that will continue to beat inflation in the long term, helping you to create wealth.', 'Raman said, ?At the moment, we are neutral on both equity and debt, but on the equity side what is true for the US is not so for India. Here we are very clearly settled into a better macro framework. Lower sustainable interest rates and inflation level can mean a sustained higher price-to-earning (P-E) rating in equity. Current valuations though are beyond that level and markets could very well remain range bound till earnings recover.?', 'So, what should you do? Reduce risk in your debt allocation and keep to accrual funds; at the same time sit tight on your long-term equity allocation but be aware of the short-term risk.']"

Or, maybe it was because of a populist Budget?\xa0On 6 February, the Sensex opened around 3% or 1,000 points lower. Some respite came during the day as it gained and closed around 500 points down.', 'For the average India-centric retail investor, the only visible trigger was the Budget. It was speculated that the fall was due to the introduction of long-term capital gains tax on 1 February 2018?the only measure announced in the Budget that would directly impact stock markets.\xa0But there were other announcements, such as the new Minimum Support Price formula, which could possibly stoke inflation. Or was it the higher fiscal deficit or higher crude oil prices, which would impact the current account deficit?

Also, it started not in February, not in January, but in December; in anticipation of the US tax reform Bill. Further, US home construction data and other economic data showed that the economy was already growing strongly; which was better than expected. This, combined with the tax reforms, led to a US bond sell-off with a global contagion. The US 30-year bond prices have been falling steadily all of January 2018, while the S&P 500 rose.', 'The reasons for the fall in bond prices (or rise in bond yields, for both 10- and 30-year US government bonds), were better economic prospects for the economy and the tax cuts. The better economic prospects would create more growth and lead the Fed to consider increasing rates faster. And the tax cuts could add fuel to the fire by putting more money in the hands of companies and consumers, thus stoking inflation; more reason for the Fed to increase rates faster.', 'Meanwhile, the stock markets were cheering the economic growth and the stimulus from the tax rate cut; leading to stock markets going up throughout January.', 'In anticipation of the 2 February 2018 employment report, bond yields started rising again from 1 February itself. Data showed that non-farm payroll employment increased by 200,000 and the unemployment rate was 4.1%?considered a nearly full employment scenario. Further, the report showed that wages had grown by 2.9%. This wage inflation and the tight labour market situation were clear indicators that inflation was likely to increase. Bond market yields started rising further (in other words, there was more selling in bond markets and yields rose) since the Fed would now have clear data points showing higher risks of inflation as well as better economic growth. Adding uncertainty to this was the fact that Jerome Powell would take over from Janet Yellen on 5 February 2018 as chair of the US Fed. Would he be more hawkish? The US bond markets and the economic data clearly indicated a high chance of the Fed hiking rates, starting March. Stock markets realized that the higher Fed rates and higher bond yields meant that the opportunity cost of holding stocks had increased, especially for the leveraged trader. Hence, a sell-off began in the stock markets on 2 February with a 666-point drop in Dow. That triggered a global stock market sell-off, including in the Sensex and the Nifty.', 'To summarize the Sherlockian saga, the good economic data from the US triggered a sell-off in bonds, which triggered a sell-off in US stocks due to higher opportunity costs (or higher discount rates, going forward). This triggered a sell-off in Indian stocks as well.', 'The forecast for earnings growth over the next 3 years for the US and European markets is in double digits. India, too, is expected to have an earnings growth of nearly 20% for FY19 and possibly even higher for the next 3 years. The forward price-to-earnings multiples are below 20; definitely not overvalued territory.', 'To close off with an ironical point: bond yields dropped again (signalling buying of bonds and rising prices) as the stock market sellers started rotating into the ?safe haven? of bonds.', 'All of this should settle down in a few days with the leveraged traders who were working with short-term borrowings exiting for the time being. With the lower market levels, the long-term cash-buying investors will start factoring in the higher future earnings even with a higher discount rate, and start buying.

From the top 15 cities, to not just the leading B15 cities, but beyond. This is where the crux of the matter is, as well as the challenge","['The increasing financialization of investment assets of the average household, since demonetization, is being widely discussed in social and media circles, and mutual funds have been a significant vehicle in this phenomenon.', 'A thrust from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is also there, in the form of bifurcation of T15 (top 15) and B15 (beyond the top 15) and some nominal incentives for B15 business. However, of late, the debate on mutual funds has been centred around the adviser versus distributor or fee versus commission model. While there is merit and propriety in saying that an entity or individual should follow only one model, let?s focus on the bigger picture. It is about the spread of awareness about market-driven investments, vis-à-vis physical or contractual return avenues, through the vehicle of mutual funds. This is challenging, given the high levels of financial illiteracy even in urban areas.', 'Having said that, if it has to be done, it has to be done through mutual funds because direct exposure to equity or bonds can be an even bigger challenge for the un-initiated investor.', 'The numbers on asset growth are there: as per the Association of Mutual Funds of India (Amfi), assets under management (AUM) from B15, as of end-December 2017, were Rs4.2 trillion, up from Rs2.86 trillion as of end-December 2016. The report further says, B15 locations have a better balance of equity and non-equity assets?60% of the assets from B15 locations are in equity schemes. Equity-oriented schemes accounted for 36% of the T15 assets. Another driver for the increase in B15 AUM, apart from what is mentioned earlier, has been the easing of returns from traditional contractual-return products and the booming equity market.', 'On a different note, a paper by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) says: ?The significant increase in inflows into mutual funds and their subsequent deployment is altering the scope of disintermediation in India?, which is an objective of the RBI. The paper further says, ?...plenty of scope for potential movement of borrowers away from banks to mutual funds.? So the move is welcome.', 'Let?s move from ?India? to ?Bharat?, that is, from urban or semi-urban to rural areas. From the top 15 cities, to not just the leading B15 cities, but beyond. This is where the crux of the matter is, as well as the challenge.', 'The first brush of financialization of investments of the average middle class or lower middle class first-time investors, moving from physical to the financial, is with the post office or a public sector bank (they have branches at remote locations) or the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC, which is distinct from the private sector insurers, and enjoys an implied government patronage).', 'The first step is moving the savings from town or villages, in the form of investment in physical assets like land or gold, to the formal system through bank deposits or an insurance policy. The next step is moving from contractual-return investments like bank deposits to market-driven investments like equity or debt.', 'The stepping stone to market-driven investments in beyond B15 (BB15) locations has to be mutual funds, as these are managed by professionals and they offer small ticket sizes for investments. But what is the incentive for mutual funds to spread business in remote locations? The current incentive for promoting business in B15 areas is being allowed to charge a little higher expense, provided they do the stipulated minimum volume of business from B15. However, given that the expenses are anyway within the stipulated limits in most cases, it does not mean much in practical terms.', 'The advertisement campaign of ?Mutual FundsSahi Hai?, initiated subsequent to bifurcation of the corpus generated from charging 2 basis points to fund expenses, between Amfi and asset management companies (AMCs), has helped. The ?language? of the campaign, being simple and on the ground, has been digested well by the target audience. (One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point).', 'More is required. There is need for touchpoints for the masses, where someone will explain and sensitize people on what are market-related investments. There are investor awareness programmes organized by mutual funds,  but there is need for something more institutionalized, more regular and more visible?like a bank branch or an LIC office, with dedicated resources. It has to be done with a non-commercial approach, that is, not for immediate conversion of the query to investment but with a long-term view of spreading awareness. If it has to be institutionalized in terms of the content and communication, Amfi has to take the lead. With the corpus generated from bifurcation of the 2 basis points of expenses charged, Amfi has the leeway to at least start a pilot project in certain remote locations.', 'Mutual funds on their part, as an allocation of the marketing budget, can distribute one free unit of a fund of their choice. They can also take up a few pilot locations for distribution of one free unit to bank account holders, to give a flavour of how market-driven investments work, preferably at a location where Amfi is setting up a representative office.', 'The long-term benefit of the concerted effort should be cost-effective.', 'Joydeep Sen is founder, wiseinvestor.in']"

On Tuesday afternoon, he watched the private rocket company that he runs, SpaceX, successfully launch its first Falcon Heavy. On Wednesday afternoon, Wall Street will watch as the public automaker that he runs, Tesla Inc., reports fourth quarter earnings.', 'Information-starved investors will be on high alert, as will hundreds of thousands of would-be drivers waiting for Tesla to produce and deliver their new electric cars. They must be optimistic: Shares were up as much as 3.6% in New York, the biggest intraday move in almost a month.', 'Here are five key questions to ask as a way to gauge Tesla?s prospects going into a decisive year.', 'How many Model 3s can Tesla actually produce?', 'The more affordable Model 3 sedan is the linchpin of Tesla?s attempt to transition from niche automaker to high-volume manufacturer, and the ramp-up so far has been muted. The first wave of cars has been delivered to paying customers, but Tesla has delayed targets several times to focus on quality and play whack-a-mole with several unspecified production bottlenecks at both its Gigafactory in Nevada and its assembly plant in California.', 'Tesla said in January that it expects a more gradual production ramp through the first quarter and intends to achieve the 5,000-per-week milestone by late June, three months later than previous guidance?and even that was already delayed a quarter. The company hasn?t yet clarified whether a 10,000-per-week run rate is still possible this year. When that question came up back in November, Musk answered with a 12-second pause.', 'Investors will be watching closely for any indication that output goals have slipped again, and any news on 2018 full-year targets and de-bottlenecking efforts will be welcome. Also avidly interested will be many of the hundreds of thousands of would-be buyers who put down $1,000 deposits, starting almost two years ago, to reserve Model 3s.', 'How far off are the long-awaited updates to Tesla?s autonomous features?', 'Musk vowed to demonstrate a completely autonomous Los Angeles-to-New York trip by the end of 2017?a feat that hasn?t yet happened. Investors and enthusiasts alike know that the chief executive officer?s timelines are often overly aggressive. But with autonomous driving now as hot as electrification?General Motors Co. vehicles are improving fast, and Alphabet Inc.?s Waymo plans to start ferrying paying passengers in Phoenix this year?there will be renewed focus on Tesla?s driverless program.', 'Things have not been smooth within the Autopilot team at Tesla. Two leaders departed in roughly the past year, and staff has suffered from inevitable talent churn. It doesn?t help that Chris Lattner, who led the team from January 2017 until June, recently got his Model 3 and threw some shade via Twitter about lack of progress on Autopilot. Tesla also recently disclosed that it didn?t test any autonomous cars on California?s public roads last year, even as Waymo churned up more than 352,000 miles.', 'Tesla charges customers $5,000 for an option called ?Enhanced Autopilot? and an additional $3,000 for an option called ?Full Self-Driving Capability.? Close observers can?t help but wonder: Does Tesla, which doesn?t use lidar, have the hardware necessary to deliver on its promises? The goal, as Musk has said, is nothing less than full self-driving mode in almost all circumstances. And what ever happened to Musk?s plan to take on Uber Technologies Inc. with the ?Tesla Network? of shared autonomous rides?', 'Have customer deposits become a major revenue stream?', 'In an unusual way for automakers to raise cash, Tesla takes deposits from customers for products that have been unveiled but are not yet in production. That amounted to a staggering $686 million on the books at the end of the third quarter, much of that from down payments for the Model 3 sedan. And in November, Tesla unveiled not just one but two new vehicles: an electric Semi truck and a next-generation Roadster sports car.', 'Deposits for the Semi and the Roadster could add a further $300 million to Tesla?s working capital, according to UBS analyst Colin Langan, and clearing inventory could add $400 million. With reservations for the ?Founders? series Roadster running at $250,000 each, could this be the moment when deposits approach $1 billion?', 'Investors would especially love to see Tesla break out deposits by vehicle, as well as for other products, including the Powerwall home battery and new solar roof. That?s something the company hasn?t previously done.', 'Is Tesla making any progress on getting into China?', 'Tesla said in November that it remains about three years from starting production in the world?s largest auto market, although Musk warned that the timeline could slip. ?Don?t set your watch by this,? Musk told an analyst at the time, calling his estimate of the wait until production starts a ?rough target.?', 'Still, Tesla?s factory needs are vast and growing. The company is bursting at the seams at its auto plant in Fremont, California, and is still building out its Gigafactory near Reno, Nevada. The company has not said where it will make its Semi truck or the new Roadster. Will Tesla expand domestic manufacturing capacity before committing to China? Or is China still top of the list?', 'India hasn?t given up its hopes of wooing the automaker, either. India?s transport minister, Nitin Gadkari, has promised to roll out the red carpet for Musk, offering land and other help to attract a Tesla plant.', 'How fast is all that cash burning?', 'Tesla was burning through $8,000 a minute last year, according toBloombergcalculations, and the slower ramp-up of the Model 3 means there?s less cash coming in the door. But the company has always been creative about financing and just sold $546 million of auto lease-backed bonds. The question looming large for Wall Street: Just how long can Tesla go before it returns to the equity or debt markets? Most analysts expect a $2 billion to $3 billion capital raise sometime this year, though the forecast as to timing is still up in the air.', '?While we believe Tesla will be able to fund the Model 3 ramp without raising additional capital, we think a raise would remove an overhang on the stock,? analyst Ben Kallo of Robert W. Baird wrote in a note.', 'Musk has had no trouble accessing the market in the past, and his new proposed pay package would help ensure he stays around to hit Tesla?s aggressive growth targets. With SpaceX?plus OpenAI, Neuralink and Boring Co.?all vying for Musk?s attention, Tesla is trying to keep its chief executive officer and largest shareholder close for the next decade.Bloomberg']"

While Cipla Ltd can?t say it was an exception, it is relatively better off than some of its peers. But the pricing pressure in the US market has led to Cipla adjusting its research spending pattern. It will use its research budget (expensed in the profit and loss account) for its generic products and use acquisitions to take forward its ambitions in the speciality product space.', 'That shift is a nod to the fact that a slower-than-expected US market sales growth could lead to research as a proportion of sales to increase faster. While this separation may help R&D as a percentage of sales to remain in check, the capital required (debt or equity) will put pressure on other parts of its profit and loss account, such as amortization or interest costs. But by focusing on late-stage candidates for acquisition, Cipla hopes to improve the odds of the product reaching market.', 'The company?s US market sales grew by 2% to $100 million over a year ago and rose by 5% sequentially. This was despite new launches in the quarter and price erosion in other products pulling down growth. If its new products continue to ramp-up and it succeeds in getting some more key approvals, growth could improve. In India, sales recovered as the market returned to normalcy post-GST (goods and services tax) roll-out. Sales growth in South Africa was healthy too.', 'Although Cipla?s overall sales grew by a relatively low 7.6%?10% adjusting for accounting effects of GST in India?it managed to do well on other fronts. Its gross profit margin (gross profit represents what is left over after deducting material costs from sales) improved, both over a year ago and sequentially. The company said a better product mix and favourable geographic share helped. It cautioned this could dip in the fourth quarter by a bit. It also kept employee costs and other expenses in check. As a result,  its operating profit rose by 20.8% over a year ago.', 'While Cipla?s relatively low sales growth is a dampener, the good showing on other fronts should comfort investors. However, it had to write down part of its acquisition of InvaGen, which cut into its net profit, and it rose by a mere 4.8% over a year ago. The company?s US business remains the key factor to watch, with a number of products in the pipeline.', 'That Cipla does not have any regulatory issues at its plants is a significant differentiator, as there are no impediments to launching these products once it gets approval. Investors should watch for how its sales growth trend improves in the next few quarters, product approvals and acquisitions for its speciality pipeline.']"

Adjusted for currency tailwinds, growth is expected to be between 0.6% and 1.6%, points out the above-mentioned analyst.

Indian companies such as TCS, on the other hand, are struggling to hold margins because of pricing pressure in the traditional services segment.', 'As such, the rally in Cognizant shares is nothing that Indian IT stocks can take comfort in. If anything, Cognizant results should act as a reality check on the sky-high valuations of Indian IT stocks, which are trading higher than their historical averages, even though there are no clear signs of a meaningful recovery in growth.']"

Investors cheered the airline?s December quarter results, with the company clocking a net profit of Rs240 crore, exceeding analysts? estimates. Earnings before tax and exceptional items increased as much as 68%.', 'What helped?', 'It?s worth recalling that the airline?s performance in the December 2016 quarter was adversely affected by demonetisation, so there?s a favourable base effect. Still, SpiceJet?s load factor was a commendable 94%. What?s also encouraging is that average fares increased 9% for the December quarter. But do note that in the year-ago quarter, fares had declined 7%. Nevertheless, fare performance last quarter was better than expectations.', 'The upshot: operating revenue increased 27% over the same period last year to Rs2,082 crore. Further, on the costs excluding fuel, the company managed well. Costs per available seat kilometre (unit cost measure for airlines) or CASK ex-fuel increased at a slower pace of 3.7%. Fuel CASK increased 17% with crude oil prices being uncomfortably high. Total CASK thus increased 8% whereas revenue per available seat kilometre moved up at a slightly faster pace of 9%.', 'The SpiceJet stock eventually ended the day about 4% higher. So far this fiscal year, it has outperformed the S&P BSE 500 index for most of the year. Currently, the stock trades at about 10 times estimated earnings for fiscal year 2019 (FY19), based onBloombergdata. That?s doesn?t appear expensive. In comparison, shares of InterGlobe Aviation Ltd (that runs the IndiGo airline) trade at about 17 times FY19?s estimated earnings.', 'But firm crude oil prices are a looming threat in the near future. Against that backdrop, pricing will be a crucial factor to follow. For the nine-month period ended 31 December, SpiceJet?s fares increased 7%. Kiran Koteshwar, chief financial officer of the company, expects this to be a sustainable growth from a near- to medium-term perspective.', 'The trajectory of its regional operations too will be worth watching. Under the UDAN scheme, SpiceJet has launched its fourth flight and secured 20 additional routes.', 'Overall, domestic passenger growth is satisfactory. Around 17% more passengers were carried by domestic airlines in 2017, according to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation. Unless crude oil prices throw up nasty surprises adversely impacting profit margins, the SpiceJet stock should get support for an easy flight.']"

It has forecast that retail inflation would be 5.1-5.2% in the first half of fiscal year 2018-19 (FY19).', 'It also sounded tough on the government for having given up fiscal frugality. Governor Urjit Patel said that significant deviations in fiscal prudence would make RBI?s job more challenging. All this was feared by the markets and bond yields had already hardened significantly.', 'But the central bank then went on to temper its own words, firstly by keeping its stance neutral and then pointing to the persistent slack in output and subdued rural wages growth. It went on to say that oil prices could move either way and not only upwards.', 'These mitigating factors sit uncomfortably in the statement, especially when RBI goes on to forecast a pickup in gross value added (GVA) growth to 7.1-7.2% in FY19.', 'Surprisingly, the central bank has forecast slowing inflation but a quickening GVA growth for the next fiscal year. RBI expects retail inflation to slow to 4.5-4.6% in the second half even as the GVA growth picks up to 7.1% from 6.6% this year.', 'The probability of this happening is low especially in the wake of minimum support price hikes and sticky but rising core inflation. Of course, the central bank does say that the lower headline inflation would be a product of a favourable base effect.', 'What this means is that these forecasts in all likelihood will be revised in future.', 'The policy statement shows that RBI is convinced about the hardening of inflation but is uncertain on the magnitude. Therefore, its arguments on mitigating factors don?t seem to have the strength of conviction behind them.', 'But, in the current market environment, who can blame it? The inconsistencies in the monetary policy statement suggest that while RBI is fully aware of the risks in its neutral stance, it is also rattled by the meltdown in equity and bond markets domestically and in global markets.', 'Fear begets fear and so the central bank has chosen not to rock the boat further by laying out its concerns categorically. Since part of its job is to manage expectations and sentiment, one cannot fault RBI for being mellow.', 'For now, it buys the market time to stabilize and will be greeted with a sigh of relief.']"

Prasanna,MPC decides to be patient,"['RBI', 'MPC', 'monetary policy', 'monetary policy committee', 'inflation']","In the past, MPC has shown flexibility in changing its inflation forecasts as data comes in. I expect the pattern to repeat this time once the government announces MSP fixing sometime in Q1FY19","['The monetary policy committee (MPC) kept policy rates and stance unchanged in its sixth bimonthly policy review, in line with consensus expectations. The policy statement was more balanced than anticipated by bond markets, leading to a relief rally in bonds. In terms of macro projections, MPC revised down both FY18 and FY19 GVA (gross value added) estimates by 10 basis points (bps) and 20bps respectively. Conversely, it revised up Q4FY18 and H1FY19 inflation estimates while keeping Q4FY19 estimates constant.', 'MPC?s inflation forecasts are somewhat inexplicable in my view. For one it has decided to look through the HRA (house rent allowance) effect in pushing up headline inflation in the 12-month period from August 2017 to July 2018.', 'However, the favourable base effects of the higher inflation that will be felt in H2FY19 is internalized in the inflation projections. Second, even including the HRA effect, MPC may be lowballing the Q1FY19 inflation at 5.6%. I see peak inflation in Q1FY19 at 6%, implying a higher average as well. It is likely that MPC?s inflation forecast is under-emphasizing the impact of higher crude prices and fiscal slippage.', 'For instance, global crude prices are up nearly 40% from July 2017; however, domestic pump prices are up only 10% in this period. Even on a conservative basis if one assumes another 10% rise in prices from here, headline inflation would be higher by about 20bps. Similarly, going by RBI?s research on inflation impact of fiscal slippage, the slippages in FY18 and FY19 should add another 15bps. Lastly, the new formula for fixing MSPs could cause inflation to go up by around 35bps. Put all this together and CPI inflation will likely touch 5% by Q4FY19. In fact, if one takes cleaner gauges of CPI excluding housing, the average inflation could be higher than 5% in that period.', 'In the past, MPC has shown flexibility in changing its inflation forecasts as data comes in. I expect the pattern to repeat this time once the government announces MSP fixing sometime in Q1FY19. Accordingly, I expect MPC to begin hiking policy rates with a 25bps hike in August this year. By then, there will be enough evidence of growth picking up on the back of recovery in consumption and exports. The only pushback against a hike by then would come if MPC has informally decided to dilute its insistence on hitting the 4% target in a durable manner. The committee may decide to allow inflation to be in the 4-6% target in order to support growth, given the fragile nature of the economy.', 'Indeed, looking at the pragmatic nature of the February policy statement, that could be a reasonable conclusion. However, I believe that MPC cannot afford to lower its guard on inflation especially when the government has pushed back the timeline for fiscal consolidation. Further global inflation pressures may be poised to rise given the tightening labour market in the US and the synchronized global recovery underway. As such, abandoning both fiscal and inflation targets at the same time could cause India to lose its cachet among foreign investors. While policy should be driven largely by domestic considerations, the global context cannot be lost sight of particularly when developed country central banks have started normalizing monetary policies.', 'Apart from policy stance and macro estimates, the interest of the market centred on RBI?s commentary about recent hardening of yields. In the event, both the governor and deputy governor negated the need for any extraordinary measures by pointing to global and domestic factors that triggered the rise in yields. This ensures that the bond market will have to find its own level in an environment of better growth, creeping inflation and higher deficits. As such, I expect the benchmark 10-year bond yield to trade in the 7.25-8% range in FY19. One source of relief could come if RBI decides to allow higher foreign portfolio investor participation in government bonds. However, I expect such a move to be paired with a road map for further reduction in banks? SLR and HTM limits. All said, higher interest rates are a reality, even if MPC decides to take its time in changing policy rates.', 'A. Prasanna is the chief economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership.']"

Ltd, an equal joint venture (JV) between TV18 and US-based media firm Viacom Inc. TV18 said it has increased its stake in the company to 51% by acquiring 1% of Viacom18?s equity from Viacom for a cash consideration of $20 million. That is not all. Viacom and Viacom18 have also extended their brand and content licence agreement by 10 years after the original 10-year agreement expired this year.', 'Currently, Viacom18 runs 42 channels in seven languages and has interests in television broadcasting, films, digital, merchandising and live events. In India, TV18 and Viacom18 also have a JV called IndiaCast for distribution of TV channels.', 'In 2016-17, Viacom18 had reported a revenue of Rs3,040.7 crore. Network18 Media and Investments Ltd-owned TV18, which operates news channels CNN-News18 and CNBC-TV18, had recorded a revenue of Rs277.3 crore in the December quarter, up from Rs254.7 crore in the year-ago period, according to a 31 JanuaryMintreport.', 'Interestingly, even senior executives at Viacom18 privately admit that the news of TV18?s stake increase came as a surprise. It was a sudden, albeit pleasant, development as it will have far-reaching implications on the day-to-day operations of Viacom18. An executive at Viacom18, on condition of anonymity, said that the step was a big deal for Mukesh Ambani?s Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), which owns TV18. RIL now has a majority stake in the venture.', 'For starters, this means that decision-making at Viacom18 will be speedier. Earlier, for any decision taken by Viacom18, Viacom needed to be consulted as it was an equal JV partner. ?Now there is only one driver in the driving seat,? said the Viacom18 executive. Quicker decision-making may translate into greater efficiency. While TV18 is in the driver?s seat as the majority shareholder, it enjoys the benefits of Viacom?s pedigree, which continues to stay invested as a 49% shareholder and has agreed to share content for another 10 years.', 'Top Viacom18 officials refuse to share details on how the deal may have come about. However, it is possible that RIL may have asked for a controlling stake as it understands the Indian media and entertainment market better than its American JV partner. In any case, the Indian television channels in the JV, namely Colors, Rishtey, Cineplex and the Colors regional bouquet are outperforming the international brands such as MTV, Nickelodeon and VH1. According to media industry estimates, the Indian channels contribute between 75% and 80% of the total revenue of Viacom18.', 'As a controlling partner, RIL can fully exploit the synergy with its telecom brand Jio, which will have more content than any other telco. Media experts say that Jio and Viacom18 could script a very successful convergence story. ?The two businesses complement each other and offer a strategic advantage. For RIL it is a fantastic decision,? said the Viacom18 executive quoted above.', 'Since RIL likes to be a big player in everything it does, it may invest in and scale up the media and entertainment business, too.', 'In fact, Viacom18?s expansion plans could get a boost. In an earlier interview, Sudhanshu Vats, group CEO of Viacom18, had said that it will launch a Tamil entertainment channel in the March quarter. Besides it had plans to move some part of its over-the-top video streaming platform Voot behind a paywall. ?We will have a dedicated offering for kids?with more content, e-books and light gaming. That will be behind a paywall,? Vats had said.', 'Viacom18 is not present in sports broadcasting. Although Vats had said that in India sports is largely cricket and cricket is a very high-investment, long-gestation game, last week he announced a tie-up with DSport, the sports channel of Discovery Communications, whereby it will telecast the Nidahas Trophy 2018 on two of its Hindi entertainment channels?Rishtey Cineplex and Cineplex HD. While DSport will telecast the cricket tri-series between India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka with English commentary, the Viacom18 channels will have the commentary in Hindi. Explaining the rationale behind the partnership, Vats said in a statement: ?Sports?represents a sizeable opportunity, but the cost of entry tends to be prohibitive. It has been a white space that we have continuously been evaluating and this association with DSport to air the Nidahas tri-series provides us with a fertile testing ground. As we endeavour to test waters with our very first broadcast of an international sporting property, what better than a cricket tri-series involving the national team.?', 'With the 51% stake in Viacom18, RIL is now a serious contender in media and entertainment.

The industry will likely respond robustly, arguing for more freedom for acquisition and leases, and over environmental clearance, among other matters. Equally, among the most aggressive inputs will be from Goa Foundation, which advocates the idea of intergenerational equity and shared wealth, quite the other end of the spectrum.', 'The principle of intergenerational equity assumes that natural resources are a commons in which the stake of future generations must be secured. Indeed, the draft policy acknowledges it. ?There is a need to understand that natural resources, including minerals, are a shared inheritance where the state is the trustee on behalf of the people to ensure that future generations receive the benefit of inheritance,? the draft policy states. It adds: ?State governments will endeavour to ensure that the full value of the extracted minerals is received by the State.? The draft policy suggests that on account of varying levels of reserves, each mineral be treated differently but with the same underlying principle.', 'It wouldn?t be an exaggeration to say that Goa Foundation?s relentless pursuit of intergenerational equity, and that of a collaborative initiative it spearheads, Goenchi Mati (literally, Goan Earth) Movement has escalated matters.

It argues for fair mining that extracts the value of a resource to the fullest. That naturally comes after respecting free, prior and informed consent of communities where a project is located, and following the strictest practicable environmental norms. Goenchi Mati advocates what it terms ?full economic rent (sale price minus cost of extraction, cost including reasonable profit for miner).? The socialist-minded effort also called for a ?permanent fund?, on the lines of what is, say, practised by Nordic countries with oil wealth: placing a percentage of such revenue in public trust for use of citizens? welfare. Goenchi Mati suggests the national pension scheme manage such funds in India, and income be distributed as a ?Citizen?s Dividend?.', 'The matter is now getting officially noticed for its ideals more than precise applications, as evidenced in the draft mineral policy. Even the Economic Survey for 2015-16 acknowledges as precedence a Supreme Court judgement based on a 2012 writ petition by Goa Foundation, which specifically mentioned intergenerational equity and sustainable development, a cap on mining in Goa, and the creation of a ?Goan Iron Ore Permanent Fund?.', 'The not-for-profit foundation has for several decades advocated pro-people attitudes and policies. Over the past decade it has gained both respect and notoriety?depending on your point of view?for taking on Goa?s mining lobbies, documenting major illegalities and corruption in the sector, escalating matters to the National Green Tribunal and Supreme Court. And, in the process contributing to the scrutinizing wrath of the justice M.B.

Later, in March 2012, under the Trinamool Congress rule, 35 more communities were recognized as OBC, 30 of them Muslim.', 'According to a statement by the state government, West Bengal had by November 2010 recognized as many as 86% of the state?s 20 million Muslim population as OBC.', 'In the 15 years till 2009, West Bengal had recognized only 66 communities as OBC, of whom 12 were Muslim. The PILs allege that the state government, before and after 2011, when the Trinamool Congress ended the Left Front?s 34-year rule, did not follow the due process to determine if these communities required reservation. The petitioners seek cancellation of the recognition.', 'In 2010, the West Bengal government asked the University of Calcutta to conduct a survey to identify the ?more backward? from backward classes, according to the petitioners. On 15 September that year, the university submitted a preliminary report, but without waiting for its final report, the state government decided to expand reservation for OBC from 7% to 17%.', 'On 24 September, the state created two categories: one with 10% reservation, and the other with 7%. The petitioners have alleged that the state government acted for the political benefit of elected representatives by creating religion-based reservation which was unconstitutional.', 'Tapan Kumar Mukherjee, a lawyer for the state, submitted in court that laws had been amended to empower the administration to recommend on its own communities that could be recognized as OBC. Subir Sanyal, the lawyer for the petitioners, however, said by the time that amendment was passed on 21 September 2010, 42 communities that were granted reservation that year had already been identified.', 'After the 2009 general election, the Left Front led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPM, realised that the Muslim community was drifting away, said a political analyst, who asked not to be named. From 2009, the CPM had a lot of discussions internally and it was decided that Muslims were to be granted reservation, this person said.', 'Politically, however, it did not benefit the CPM because it had no time to show how the reservation helped, according to the political analyst. The Trinamool Congress carried on with it, and now appears to have gained from it, he added. ?But for the community it means little because reservations would help only if new jobs were created,? he said.', '?OBC or not, Muslims still have to bribe government officials for jobs,? alleged Qazi Fazlur Rahman, a respected community leader in Kolkata. ?The aim of declaring Muslim communities as OBC appears to be political gains only.?', 'Abdus Sattar, a CPM leader and a former minister for minority development, said it was found that Hindu communities were benefitting from reservation whereas Muslims in the same profession were not recognized as OBC. The aim was to create ?equal opportunity? for all communities in the same situation, he added.', 'However, things may not have improved much. Muslims accounted for a little over 9% of people employed with the state police, but even with almost eight years of reservations, things have not improve much, he claimed.

In line with our expectations, it left the repo rate unchanged at 6%, retained the neutral stance of monetary policy and reiterated the commitment toward achieving the medium-term inflation target of 4%.', 'As anticipated, the decision to keep the repo rate unchanged was not unanimous, with one MPC member voting for a hike of 25 basis points (bps). Additionally, the inflation forecast for Q4 FY2018 was revised upward, while the baseline expectation for GVA growth for FY2018 was pared mildly.', 'However, the tone of the policy outlook was less hawkish than what the markets had started to fear. The caution regarding the need for vigilance around the evolving inflation scenario clouded by upside risks was counterbalanced by the emphasis on nurturing the nascent recovery through conducive and stable macro-financial management.', 'To recap, the CPI inflation spiked to 5.2% in December 2017, overshooting MPC?s earlier forecast. In maintaining status quo, MPC appears to have looked through the impact of the revision in house rent allowance (HRA) for central government employees on the uptick in the CPI inflation. Moreover, the presence of mitigants, such as subdued capacity utilization, moderate rural wage growth and the possibility of crude oil prices receding from current levels, supported MPC?s decision to maintain rates and persist with the neutral stance.', 'Nevertheless, the sixth bi-monthly policy statement highlighted various risks, including the first and second round impact of the staggered revision in HRA by state governments; the possibility that firms may pass on higher global commodity prices to consumers; and the proposals made in the Union budget for FY2019 to augment minimum support prices (MSP), increase customs duty on certain items, and delay fiscal consolidation. In particular, MPC commented that the fiscal slippage has started to raise economy-wide costs of borrowing, which may spark inflationary pressures going forward. Based on these risks, MPC revised its inflation estimate for Q4 FY2018 (including the HRA impact) to 5.1%, above its earlier forecast of 4.3-4.7% for H2 FY2018. Moreover, it expects CPI inflation to harden to 5.1-5.6% in H1 FY2019, followed by a moderation to 4.5-4.6% in H2 FY2019, albeit with risks tilted to the upside. The expected softening in inflation in H2 FY2019 is attributed a favourable base effect related to the waning impact of the HRA revision from July 2018 onwards, and the expectation that a normal monsoon and effective supply management would dampen food inflation. Overall, MPC emphasized caution about the evolving inflation scenario.', 'MPC mildly revised its baseline expectation for GVA growth for FY2018 to 6.6% from 6.7%. It pegged the GVA growth forecast for FY2019 at 7.2% with risks evenly balanced, with an anticipated easing from 7.3-7.4% in H1 FY2019 to 7.1-7.2% in H2 FY2019. It attributed the improvement in FY2019 GVA growth to factors such as the stabilization of the economy after the transition to GST; signs of a nascent investment revival provided by rising credit growth, equity fundraising, imports and capital goods production; the ongoing recapitalisation of public sector banks; and the prospect of rising exports on the back of an improving global economy. However, it warned of downside risks from the deterioration in public finances, which might crowd out private financing and investment.', 'Looking ahead, the emphasis placed by the committee on nurturing the fledgling recovery and on stability suggests that it would prefer to wait for additional data on the extent to which the upside risks to inflation materialize. Therefore, it is unlikely to hike rates in the immediate term, in our view. However, if CPI inflation exceeds MPC?s forecast in a sustained manner, a rate hike toward the second half of 2018 may not be ruled out.', 'The softer-than-expected tone of the policy document should help to contain yields of government securities (G-secs) to some extent, even though the prospects of open market operations being conducted by the central bank to purchase G-secs appear dim. Regardless, global trends related to liquidity, inflation and interest rates would continue to influence the direction of Indian bond yields in the near term.', 'Aditi Nayar is principal economist at Icra.']"

If the headline CPI inflation follows the guidance path, then a prolonged pause on policy rates will remain as the base case","['The monetary policy committee in its last meeting for the financial year voted to keep the repo rate unchanged at 6% and maintain a neutral stance. The accompanying statement struck a balanced tone, pointing out that while the risks to inflation are on the upside and hence vigilance is required, a nascent recovery is in the offing and that needs to be supported too. The decision was, however, not unanimous as one member voted for a 25 basis points rate hike. The underlying growth and inflation forecasts and the uncertainties around the inflation outlook seem to have prompted the majority of the MPC to seek more clarity through income data and other developments.', 'The guidance on the future path of inflation is cautious. Headline CPI inflation is expected to rise from an average of 4.6% in Q3 to 5.1% in Q4 and range between 5.1% and 5.6% in the first half of FY19, before easing to 4.5-4.6% in the second half. The balance of risks to this trajectory are on the upside and emanate from higher oil prices, rising non-oil inputs costs being passed to output prices and elevated household inflation expectations. Overall inflation outlook is subject to significant uncertainty from the staggered impact of implementation of HRA hikes by states, fiscal slippage, and changing expectations about the pace of global monetary policy normalization. The statement also notes that the new guidelines for fixing MSPs for the kharif crop in 2018 is an area of uncertainty and any impact assessment on inflation is difficult at this stage.', 'Interestingly, easing inflation in the second half of the next fiscal year assumes softer food inflation, and that may actually turn out to be the key source of upward drift from the RBI?s trajectory. It is reasonable to assume that the under the new formula and ahead of the national elections next year, average MSP increases may turn out to be larger than what the government has provided in the last four years. That, in turn, would stoke food inflation even with a normal monsoon and lead to higher-than-anticipated inflation. It thus appears that while the balance of risks is seen on the upside, the overall approach on the future guidance on inflation is less conservative than in the past.', 'Balancing its concerns on inflation, MPC also acknowledged that economic recovery is in a nascent stage and needs to be supported. RBI projects real GVA growth to pick up to 7.2% in FY19, up from 6.6% growth forecast in the current fiscal and the risks to this growth path are evenly balanced.', 'RBI continues to project higher growth in FY18 versus the CSO?s advance estimate of 6.1%. Signs of revival in investment activity and stabilization of GST implementation, are seen driving growth higher over this year and the next. This appears to be a reasonable estimate of growth, considering the recent improvement in manufacturing sector activity and a synchronized pick-up in global economic activity. However, weak private services sector activity (as seen from PMI services reading hovering close to the 50 mark) and the drag from net external demand are something which could impart some downside to this forecast.', 'Going forward, the path of monetary policy would be dependent on how the actual inflation and GDP growth evolve. If the headline CPI inflation follows the guidance path, then a prolonged pause on policy rates will remain as the base case. However, the upside risks to inflation (especially from food inflation and rising commodity prices) may outweigh the downside from low capacity utilization and possible correction in oil prices. The likelihood of actual inflation drifting towards the upper level of the inflation tolerance band (6%) has therefore increased. That may call for not only vigilance on inflation but a pre-emptive rate hike in July or August without changing the neutral stance. For the policy stance to change to hawkish, not only do some of the inflation risks have to gain strength, but even the growth out-turn has to be better than the RBI projections, thereby stoking demand-push inflation.', 'Gaurav Kapur is the chief economist of IndusInd Bank Ltd.

The budget speech showed the state?s revenues are flat or falling, while spending is up.', 'Finance minister Thomas Isaac blamed the goods and services tax (GST) for most of the revenue shortfall.', '?The common assumption that tax revenue will increase with the rollout of GST has not become a reality. The reason is simple: the administrative system for GST is not yet functional,? he said in his budget speech.', '?I expected Kerala?s revenues to increase by 20-25% after GST, but it is still growing below 10%. The Rs1.35 lakh crore IGST (integrated goods and services tax, one of the three categories of tax under GST) collected so far has not been distributed to the states. The IGST is also leaking. Seventy-five percent of goods used in Kerala comes from outside the state. This should mean the IGST should be at least the double of the SGST (state goods and services tax), but that has not happened,? he said.', 'However, he admits the shrinkage of state?s own revenue has contributed to the problem. ?Revenue from the tax on petroleum products and registration stamps (the two main taxes which are still under the state?s control) are also growing at a slower pace than expected (at 18% and 11.3%, respectively). Kerala?s tax revenue income increased only at 5.2%, contrary to the estimated 16.08% increase in the previous budget. The total revenue income increased 7.7% only, while the plan fund expenditure increased 22% and unplanned expenditure increased 21%,? he said.', 'The mismatch between the revenue and expenditure, Isaac says, has made it hard for the government to find money for new projects. In turn, the budget calls for severe fiscal discipline. Including this budget, each budget ahead will try to narrow revenue deficit by 20-30 basis points and keep it below the 3% limit allowed for states, Isaac said. One basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.', 'However, the government has not sacrificed expenditure on social welfare. The government will continue with its plan to spend Rs 4,000 crore to build social and physical infrastructure under a recently floated government company called Kerala Institutional Investment Fund Board or KIIFB.', '?If we have to look for capital expenditure under the usual budgetary schemes, we will have to wait for at least two decades to find the money. That will mean a generation will lose out on opportunities. Instead, we will do it today under KIIFB,? Isaac said.', 'The budget has given a grant of Rs4,270 crore for KIIFB to foot its bills for the next four months. For the rest of the year and projects, it is expected to raise the money from the market in the form of chit funds, bonds and guarantees?all of which will be outside budget borrowings, planned to be repaid using the state?s own tax revenue and other means.', 'The budget has also kept funding intact for most ongoing welfare schemes, including a plan to build houses for the homeless, urban and rural food security measures, projects to give public schools a facelift, and healthcare and pension schemes.', 'Isaac announced Rs2,500 crore for the affordable housing project, Rs954 crore for food subsidy measures, about Rs1,000 crore for reviving public schools and Rs6,000 crore for distributing welfare pensions. There are even certain fresh expenditures, like an allocation of Rs2,000 crore for coastal area development in the wake of destruction caused by cyclone Ockhi and a Rs3,400 crore loan to revive the state road transport company.', 'A new health insurance scheme announced in the Union budget on Thursday to provide Rs2 lakh cover each to one million families would have saved Kerala some money, as it is already giving over five million families health insurance of about Rs10 lakh using both central and state funds. Instead, Isaac?s budget states it will foot the premium of those who may be left out once the new scheme is implemented, and ensure the beneficiary list is unchanged.', 'The budget has discouraged departments from buying cars priced above Rs14 lakh and promoting the use of rental cars and cab aggregators. The finance minister also wants public officials to use video conferencing more so as to reduce travel expenses. Foreign trips will be allowed only if they are absolutely necessary, he said. Government offices are also asked to consider switching away from high-cost landline telephones to low-cost mobile connections to cut phone bills. Creation of new government posts, as well as allowing new grants for aided institutions, will be judicious.', 'The budget also proposed not to give welfare pensions to those having houses bigger than 1200 sq. ft, or two acres of land or non-taxi cars with more than 1,000cc engine capacity. Such measures could turn controversial, said one CPM leader, requesting not to be named, as people are used to a particular level of state support.', 'A proposal to raise the fair price of land by 10% and service charges for registration of land deals by 5%, may also prove unpopular, he said. A similar revision was introduced by the previous Congress-led government in 2015, he said, but it was reversed after a severe backlash from the public and local bodies, including those ruled by the Left. ?At any rate, it is clear that going ahead, it will not be business as usual.?']"

It was the 2015 Iran nuclear deal that was seen as the major factor for pulling Israel and its Gulf Arab neighbours together. Sunni majority Saudi Arabia that wields considerable influence in the Gulf region perceives Shia-dominated Iran as an ideological threat and a competitor for influence in the region. And Israel sees Iran as an existential threat. And any deal that was seen as freeing Iran from international sanctions has been opposed by both the Gulf states and Israel.', 'The Saudi move can ?also be seen as influence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the region,? said theHaaretzreport.

If you still haven?t tried them out, here is your chance.', 'How are AR stickers different from regular stickers?', 'What separates AR stickers from regular stickers, available in a number of camera and messenger apps, is their three-dimensional design which looks more realistic. So an AR sticker when placed on a static or moving horizontal surface such as table, floor, or hand, will look like a part of the actual 3D space in front of the camera, unlike regular stickers which look more like flat 2D images. Users can capture them as photos or record them as video clips or GIFs.', 'How to use them', 'The AR stickers in Motion Stills are available under the AR mode and show right on the home screen, allowing users to get to them quickly. Users can drop them in the space in front of the camera by tapping on the sticker icon. Once the sticker shows on the screen, users can place them anywhere in the space by tapping on the screen. They can also change its orientation and size with simple pinch and zoom gestures. These stickers work offline and can be accessed anytime. The number of AR stickers available in Motion Stills is limited compared to stickers on the Pixel smartphones. It includes only 6 objects, including alien, dinosaur, hen and robot, as of now.', 'How AR mode works', 'The AR stickers in Motion Stills will work with any Android smartphone. It doesn?t require special AR sensors to track distance and position, but relies on the camera sensor, accelerometer and gyroscope, which are available on all smartphones. Accelerometer is used to detect the initial orientation of the smartphone and its position with respect to the ground plane, while gyroscope is used to track sideways rotation and twist so the app can render the virtual object in the exact position users want to put it in the space in front of the camera.']"

Conventional markets like the US, UK, Australia and the Middle East aside,Padmanis the first Akshay Kumar film to have a same day and date release in regions like Iraq, Russia, Congo and the Ivory Coast. It will also be the widest release for Kumar in countries like Germany, Austria, Netherlands and Belgium.

At Sony, we have the ability to give this film that global reach that it deserves,?

Industry experts point out that the exhaustive marketing campaign, with Kumar and his entertaining social reformist image, at its centre, are meant to counter that.', '?Akshay is such a ubiquitous star that he?s got an audience across segments. The hallmark of this campaign is that there is something for everybody,?

Balki?s brainchild, a veteran adman and former group chairman of the Mullen Lowe Lintas Group.', 'But Sony hasn?t limited its strategies to digital. Apart from regular print and radio advertisements, there have been screenings organized for school girls in places like Gujarat. Kumar also flagged off events like the Delhi University Women?s Marathon and the Startup Carnival Franchise India. A comic show on Sony Entertainment Television calledSuper Night with Padmanwas meant to reach out to family audiences.', '?It?s a prudent, smart and effective campaign,? Uboweja said, adding that the one reason Kumar is so central to it is to keep costs low, considering that the film with its sensitive messaging will have limited and not mainstream audience appeal. ?It may not be the typical Salman Khan grosser given that people (in India) would still pay to watch something that is purely illogical and entertaining, as compared to something that would have a social message. But the campaign is helping the film reach its potential.?', 'Padman, which was earlier slated to release on 25 January, was pushed due to the chaos surrounding Sanjay Leela Bhansali?sPadmaavat. Krishnani said it was not just an act of solidarity for fellow industry members but also helpful for their own film?s prospects.', '?We hope that this film touches a chord with the people in India, there is huge anticipation, and we are hoping that translates into box office,? he said, adding that the studio is quite bullish as far as the India market is concerned.', '?We are looking at building a progressive slate for Sony here in India, not just in Hindi but other regional languages as well. The plan is to have a healthy pipeline and at Sony we have the expertise to understand and deliver content.

Scientists have said that actinorhodins could now be the basis of a new antibiotic drug.', 'With modern-day diseases becoming increasingly resistant to existing drugs, biological scientists and chemists at Leeds are now re-examining these old compounds, applying advances in science and technology to test more precisely whether they could still hold the key to a future drug.', '?At the time scientists did not fully differentiate the individual compounds within the family when they examined them, leading to a less than precise picture of their properties. This prompted my team to divide the family and select a specific compound (y-ACT) for further evaluation, using an array of 21st century approaches, to assess its potential and to understand how it works against bacteria,? Alex O?Neill, professor at from the Antimicrobial Research Centre at the University of Leeds, said.', 'O?Neill and colleague professor Chris Rayner from the University?s School of Chemistry have published their findings in the journalScientific Reports, and believe the compound is worth serious consideration as the basis for a new drug to combat certain types of bacterial infections.', '?y-ACT exhibits potent antibacterial activity against two important representatives of the ESKAPE class of pathogens, which are bacteria that have developed the ability to ?escape? the action of existing drugs. A major challenge in tackling the problem of antibiotic resistance is to discover new drugs?our study shows that potentially useful drug candidates can be ?discovered? from amongst the antibiotics we already know about,? O?Neill said.', '?The weak activity previously published for the ACT family as a whole probably explains why this group was not further evaluated, and it is intriguing to think that other potentially useful antibiotic groups are languishing in obscurity in academic journals just needing expert review using modern processes and equipment,? he said.', 'Scientists have said that by studying compounds which have antibacterial properties, as shown by past research, there is scope to fast-track the challenging early stages of drug discovery.', 'Interestingly, on similar lines, another research of Michael Webb from School of Chemistry, University of Leeds, focused on a compound called pentyl pantothenamide, first assessed in the 1970s. Then, it was found to be able to stop the growth of E.coli bacteria but not completely kill the bacteria, so was never taken into clinical use.', 'At the time, scientists did not understand how it was able to stop the growth, but Webb and his team have proved it is driven by Vitamin B5, which is used to metabolise energy. Bacteria have to make B5 and a key part of the machinery they use to do so is called the PanDZ complex.', 'Pentyl pantothenamide targets the PanDZ complex, preventing E.coli from making Vitamin B5 and so starving it of the means to grow. ?The results of our latest study open up the possibility of designing new drugs that use the same means to attack E. coli, but in a more effective way,? said Webb.', '?Until recently, no new antibiotics had been discovered for 25 years. O?Neill?s research is important: it?s providing another way of looking for potential antibiotics and could hold the key to uncovering options that were overlooked before but may be incredibly useful now,? he said.']"

But as the restrictions gather pace, it?s becoming increasingly clear that nobody has a precise handle on vital data showing if the measures are working. There isn?t even agreement or consistency as to what to constitutes a single-use plastic bag: governments and agencies often use different thicknesses in their definitions.', '?No one can tell you on a global level if we are making progress on the amount of plastic that ends up in the ocean,? says Rob Opsomer, systemic initiatives lead at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity promoting the reuse and recycling of materials.', 'The plastic bag?s ascent to ubiquity is in stark contrast to its humble beginnings. Made from a material that was invented by accident in the 1930s, it wasn?t until 1962 that the first patent of what we now think of as a plastic bag emerged. Its rise from there was meteoric, with the patent approved for a company called Celloplast in 1965, before being brought into the mass market by chemical businesses like Mobil.', 'Still, small-scale data sets suggest restrictions do work. For example, curbs in Wales and Northern Ireland appeared to cut usage in those countries by about 80% between 2010 and 2014, according to WRAP, a group that monitored usage for the UK government over that period. While it appears success then spread across the UK, Defra, the government department that took over monitoring, counted bag usage differently to WRAP.', 'Either way, such studies don?t provide a global picture. Retailers in England covered by a government charge supplied 2.1 billion single-use bags in the year to April 2017, according to Defra. That?s 0.6% of the 330 billion single-use plastic bags that the The Ellen MacArthur Foundation reckons are used globally annually. The data for Northern Ireland and Wales account for just 0.03% of worldwide consumption.', 'The European Union has a target of using 90 bags per person by the end of 2019, or 46 billion based on its current population. The European Commission, which previously said better data are needed, estimates that approximately 100 billion were used in 2016.', 'One way to get a handle on the usage of bags is to monitor the consumption of the type of plastic that?s used to make them. That?s a category of high-density polyethylener?HDPE for short?known as film and sheet. IHS Markit Inc., which compiles figures in its annual Polyethylene World Analysis Report, sees the overall category continuing to expand.', '?Under our current view we continue to see year over year global demand growth in the film and sheet category globally,? says Joel Morales Jr., executive director of Polyolefins Americas at IHS. That?s because the growth of the middle class in high population countries like India and China will continue to be a boon for plastics demand, he said.', 'Measures to curb the use of single-use bags are also partly offset by people switching to thicker, more plastic-intensive bags, as highlighted in a 2014 review of a ban imposed by Australia?s Capital Territory. While those are usually designed to be reused and recycled, it highlights the importance of clear data and well-defined objectives in improving the way we consume plastic.', 'And all the while, bags are a tiny subset of the plastics industry. Sacks and bags made of ethylene represented less than 10% of plastics imported into the US in 2016, according to the Plastics Industry Association. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation estimates that plastic bags make up just 3% of plastic usage globally. And given how little we know about the number of bags out there, producing data for the remaining 97% of plastic consumption is going to be a growing problem as governments try and manage their use.', '?One of the elements we need going forward is to have a much better body of evidence, understanding and transparency on what plastic usage is,? Opsomer said. ?We need to have that evolving year on year, as we can on climate.?Bloomberg']"

SBICAP Securities Ltd said in a note on Blue Star.', 'Voltas is holding a conference call with analysts on Friday where its views on the electromechanical projects division will be aired.', 'That said, given the lumpy nature of the electromechanical projects business, the focus for now will be on the coming summer season. Change in energy efficiency norms?an AC which had a five-star rating until a year ago will become a four-star AC now, effectively raising the price of the latter?and a rise in raw material costs will put upward pressure on AC prices this season. Navigating this can be a major challenge sans a healthy demand recovery.', 'Dealer checks in the northern part of the country by John Perinchery, an analyst at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd, shows that consumer demand was rather subdued in the December quarter. Sales during Diwali were soft. If consumer demand does not see a noticeable recovery in March, then dealers may well reduce product offtake in the current quarter (Q4), which will weigh on company sales, says Perinchery.', 'Much therefore depends on a consumer demand recovery in the summer season. That will not only decide the prospects of AC makers but will also provide clarity about consumer demand trends, he adds.']"

Even better, it matched analysts? revenue and profit expectations.', 'Although the stock rose by 1.6% on Thursday on favourable news and a positive mood on the Street, it may be too early to rejoice. After all order flows are lumpy in this sector and the third quarter accretion maybe a flash in the pan. On a cumulative basis, the nine-month order flow of Rs15,750 crore in fiscal year 2018 (FY18) is sharply lower when compared to the year-ago period. Therefore, Bhel would have to ramp-up orders in the fourth quarter to be able to sustain order flow growth and keep the order book at the current level of Rs1.02 trillion.', 'All this fuss about order flows is justified given that the company has steadily seen revenue falling (see chart) due to poor orders coming in from the power sector, which accounts for about 80% of its revenue. Moreover, a year back, a significant portion of the company?s order book was slow-moving.', 'After notching up Rs47,963 crore in FY12, Bhel?s annual revenue steadily declined to Rs28,222 crore in FY17, leading to a fall in profits and drop in the stock price that consistently underperformed benchmark indices.', 'So, the 5% year-on-year jump in net revenue during the December quarter that along with stringent cost-control measures translated into an operating profit growth of 32% was a welcome change. This was in spite of a 53% jump in other expenses that was due to higher one-time provisioning.', 'Further, the management (in the conference call) appeared confident of raking in strong orders in the current quarter, which should see the year pull through a strong order book at the end of FY18.', 'In fact, Bhel?s stock performance would hinge largely on order flows in the forthcoming quarters. Will the power sector that is weighed down with overcapacity dish out large orders for firms such as Bhel? If not, will the government take steps to resuscitate this behemoth by a strategic shift into new areas?', 'Another critical factor is the company?s profitability. The December quarter?s operating margin of 4.5% came nearly 100 basis points higher than the year-ago period, but has not been consistently improving. Large orders that got stuck for want of liquidity or clearances or even stalled projects, can adversely impact the profit margin.', 'In other words, consistent order flows and profitability are the need of the hour for investors to gain confidence in Bhel. At Rs95, the stock trades at about 19 times estimated FY19 earnings, which although expensive may look reasonable if the company can ramp- up net profit as it did in the December quarter.']"

For the December quarter, this yardstick increased 10.4%, a notch higher than 10.2% seen in the September quarter.

A basis point is 0.01%.', 'Rent and other expenses increased at a relatively slower place, boosting operating profit, which rose by 38% to Rs215 crore. As mentioned earlier, net profit increased at a much faster pace even though ?other income? fell sharply. What boosted net profit growth was the substantial 58% decline in interest costs. Interest cost reduction during the quarter was a function of: demerger of HomeTown, conversion of debentures worth Rs150 crore and working capital efficiency kicking in during the quarter, inform analysts from Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt.

Yet, Guo Shuqing running the PBOC after Zhou Xiaochuan?s retirement would  be reason for optimism","['China?s Zhou Xiaochuan sure knows how to make an exit.', 'For months now, investors and corporate chieftains have been biting their nails about the retirement of Beijing?s central-bank governor. Zhou, who just turned 70, appears to have engineered a path for Guo Shuqing, a reform-minded, former People?s Bank of China (PBOC) deputy, to replace him. That?s comforting news, allaying fears President Xi Jinping might install a yes-man in the pivotal job. Tapping Guo is a clear sign Xi means to accelerate financial upgrades.', 'That?s a short-term negative for Asia, but a huge positive in the medium-to-long term. Any serious drive to recalibrate growth engines from excessive credit and investment to services will slow gross domestic product?probably to well below 6%. A positive because China getting a handle on duelling bubbles in credit, debt, property and pollution will stabilize Asia?s biggest economy, avoiding a Japan-like crash.', 'Caveats abound, of course. Anyone who thinks the process will be smooth and orderly is dreaming. China?s $38 trillion banking systems, with its M.C. Escher world of shadow banks, off-balance-sheet vehicles and state-owned enterprises, is the quintessential financial riddle. The closer you look, the more bizarre things seem. A key problem is that all too many Communist Party bigwigs in Xi?s orbit are getting fantastically rich off Beijing?s tangled web of wealth and influence. Xi will have to be brave in internationalizing China Inc.', 'Yet, Xi selecting Guo to run the PBOC would be good news as these things go.', 'Currently, Guo is head of the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC), which has been terrorizing the banking system (in a good way), a campaign that dovetails with efforts by Zhou and Xi to clean up the banking system, curb financial excesses and make Chinese growth less about unproductive borrowing and more about innovation and organic demand.', 'I list Zhou before Xi here because he?s the real driving force behind the biggest Chinese reforms since 2002. De-pegging the yuan from the dollar in 2006 bore his fingerprints. So did moves since then to liberalize the capital account, scrap deposit rate caps and get the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to include the yuan in its top-five currency list. Zhou also was instrumental to China navigating around the worst of 2008 Lehman Brothers crisis.', 'In recent years, though, Beijing shifted from retooling to stimulus?in a big way, adding tens of trillions of dollars in new credit. In November, for example, China continued to hit fresh credit-expansion records?$170 billion that month ?despite assertive efforts to clamp down on financial excesses. At the same time, even the good news can seem bad. Case in point: the amount of fresh credit needed to gin up $1 of output was about 28 cents last year, compared with 30 cents in 2016. Still, it?s high by developing-economy standards.', 'Guo?s eclectic resume could make him uniquely qualified to impose some lending sobriety. Along with serving as vice PBOC governor, Guo has been governor of Shandong province, chairman of China Construction Bank, head securities regular and directed the state agency that oversees Beijing?s $3 trillion of currency reserves. At the CBRC, Guo has gone after industry malpractice, rejiggered lending practices and made cross-holdings of financial products less opaque.', '?If Guo is appointed, it will be a ringing endorsement by Xi of his energetic approach to tackling reform in the financial sector, and Guo will lead that position from the PBOC,? says Evan Medeiros, managing director, Asia, at Eurasia Group.', 'Guo is also proving to be a bit of a hunter?of so-called gray rhinos. The reference here is to a phrase popularized by American author Michele Wucker: ?highly probable, high impact yet neglected threat: kin to both the elephant in the room and the improbable and unforeseeable black swan?.', 'None loom larger in Beijing?s cross hairs than globally-acquisitive giants such as Anbang Insurance Group, Dalian Wanda Group, Fosun Group, HNA Group and Zhejiang Luosen Neili. With their debt-fuelled transactions, they?re becoming too big and too indebted to fail. Guo has been at the centre protecting China from these and other ?hidden dangers? Beijing must address to thrive.', 'It?s an underappreciated threat to Chinese stability. Two years ago, hardly a week passed without Anbang, Dalian Wanda or HNA entering high-profile merger talks overseas?vanity purchases to increase global footprints. Now, they?re all scrambling to shed assets to cover debts. HNA alone is shopping around about $16 billion of asset sales in the next few months.', 'China faces daunting challenges in 2018, and numerous things could go awry, including US President Donald Trump waging a trade or currency war. Yet, it?s heartening to see Xi leaning toward a PBOC successor with an intimate understanding of the mechanics behind China?s credit and debt excesses. More importantly, a man with the gumption to curb them once and for all. Guo running the PBOC would  be reason for optimism, a sign Xi is more than just talk.', 'William Pesek, based in Tokyo, is a former columnist forBarron?sandBloombergand author ofJapanization: What the World Can Learn from Japan?s Lost Decades.', 'His Twitter handle is @williampesek']"

India has decided to move from BS-IV now to BS-VI by 2020, leapfrogging the intermediate BS-V norms.', 'In Delhi, the requisite fuel will be made available from 1 April, the petroleum ministry said in November. The decision has forced automakers to go back to the drawing board and reschedule their product plans.', 'Upgrading to the higher emission norms requires significant investments in engines and research and development (R&D). Honda is the largest scooter maker in India and claims to be the largest selling two-wheeler brand in 15 out of 29 states in the country.', 'At the ongoing Auto Expo, the company exhibited just one new product? X-Blade?with a 160cc engine.', 'Apart from that the subsidiary of the Honda Motor Co. showcased a new variant of its immensely popular scooter, Activa.', 'Kato said that the company plans to set up a fifth factory  in the country but is yet to take a final decision because of the introduction of the BS-VI norms will increase the prices of two-wheelers which will lead to decline in sales.', '?Not only Honda, other manufacturers will also have to comply with the norms, so production cost will increase. Hence, we need to increase price as well. So, the total motorcycle industry will decrease in sales in 2020,? Kato said.', 'The Japanese company has more than doubled its local market share since 2010 to 29% and now threatens to dethrone its former joint venture partner Hero MotoCorp Ltd from the top position.', 'Since Hero and Honda parted ways, Hero?s market share has declined to 37% from 45% in 2010. Honda takes credit for making a dent in Hero?s share of the market by revolutionizing the scooter segment, which in the beginning was an urban phenomenon but has now begun to make inroads into rural India?Hero?s stronghold.', 'To be sure, Honda is not the first company to warn about a delay in new product launches due to the new emission norms.', 'Royal Enfield, owned by Eicher Motors Ltd, decided against introducing new products in the domestic market before the new emission norms kick in. After the announcement of its second quarter earnings, Siddharha Lal, managing director and chief executive of Eicher Motors, said that the company will not launch any new models over the next two years and the next new offering will be just before BS VI norms kick in.', 'In the four-wheeler segment as well, the pipeline for new models has dried up as most manufacturers have already invested heavily in upgrading their existing models. There were 10 launches in 2013, which fell to nine in 2014 and rose to 12 in 2015, before plunging to five each in 2016 and 2017, according to Morgan Stanley Research.', 'According to Pratap Bose, head of design at Tata Motors Ltd, the challenge is not about moving to the new norms but more about bringing stability to policy.', '?Adhering to BS-VI is never a challenge but the timelines should not shift and move. The challenge is to plan to a particular date. I don?t think doing the job itself is an issue,? Bose said in an interview.']"

Given accelerated adoption of alternative fuels globally, US becoming significant producer of crude at 10 million barrels a day ?with shale gas break even below $50 bbl, etc? we do not see a major spike in oil price. Inflation would see a seasonal uptick with the onset of summer and pulled-up by increase in MSP (minimum support price) of agricultural products. According to the RBI study the impact of increase in MSP on inflation is much lower since, despite 150 products being under MSP, the market price is lower than MSP only in handful of cases and active intervention is required sporadically for a few of those.

And that has some profound implications for artificial intelligence.,"['On a long bus ride with some friends recently, I found one was playing chess on his iPad. That is, he was playing against the little machine?or if you like, against the chess app on the little machine. I leaned over and asked: ?Who?s winning??', 'To my surprise, he said with a sheepish smile: ?I am!? Then he explained. Every now and then, he was getting the program to suggest moves for him. Or he was taking back moves that he had made and reconsidered. Or he was asking the program to take back moves that he found particularly threatening. No wonder he was winning.', 'Still, you will appreciate that mine was a rhetorical question. I?ve played occasionally against these chess programs, and it isn?t easy at all. Compared to me, they play at warp speed and nearly every move asks tough questions of my limited chess abilities. Sometimes it feels like I?m battling an onrushing tide of chess prowess, coming at me relentlessly. So when I saw my friend playing, I expected that his iPad would win the game.', 'This has been a reasonable expectation for a couple of decades now, even if you match better players than my friend against better chess programs than the iPad?s. It was in 1997 that a chess computer, Deep Blue, first beat a world chess champion?Garry Kasparov?in a match. Since then, chess computers have only improved.', 'Ever since humans invented the computer, getting one to play chess well has been a sort of holy grail of computing. Here was a game with a set of rules that was relatively simple to instruct a computer about. At the same time, the rules and the board it is played on can produce an essentially infinite number of possible games, thus offering a level of complexity challenging enough to fuel research into artificial intelligence (AI). (To put that in perspective, consider what kind of triumph it would be to produce a program that wins at noughts-and-crosses). Naturally, the earliest chess computers were pushovers for even strictly amateur players?I remember how thrilled I was to win a game against one in the late 1980s. But they got better fast. If you look at so-called Elo ratings, which tell you how strong a given player is at the game, computers have scored higher than the best humans for years?higher, in fact, than the highest Elo rating, 2,882, any human has ever achieved. (Deep Blue itself was never rated, because IBM retired it before it played enough games against players who themselves had Elo ratings).', 'So how do these programs work? In effect, by looking several moves ahead and evaluating the positions that result. That?s what humans do too. The further ahead you can look on any given move, the more you are able to compare positions and decide which is better, the more likely you are to win the game. So when I?m thinking about my next move, I?m considering what my opponent might do in response, and how I might respond to that. That?s just two moves into the future, but I am rarely able to go further. This probably explains why I?m no more than your average chess dabbler. Yet, this short-sighted view is hardly surprising, because there are usually plenty of moves available, and plenty of responses to them, and plenty of responses to those?that is, the number of possible positions rises exponentially with each possible move, and it?s humanly impossible to evaluate each one. Even the best players can only look a few moves into the future. Even then, they can prune possibilities by relying on intuition and expertise about which moves to consider and which to ignore.', '', 'But a computer? In theory, it could look at every possible move from a given position, any number of steps into the future. All it needs is the time to do that. But a chess computer that takes several hours to find the best move is, after all, hardly a chess computer. So to play chess reasonably, computers needed to get fast enough not just to apply rules, look ahead and decide on the best move in a given position, but do all that in a reasonable time. It had more going for it, but that essentially described Deep Blue, the world-beater of 1997.', 'And yet, give this some thought. If a chess computer is merely applying rules and evaluating positions, albeit at phenomenal speeds, can we really say it is intelligent? Microsoft Excel can add up the numbers in a column much faster than you or I can. Can we really say Excel is intelligent? This is why AI researchers have never quite been persuaded of the worth of getting computers to play chess in this way. No doubt Deep Blue represented a triumph of programming and exploiting the power of computers, but calling that AI is a stretch. Why are we humans intelligent, after all?', 'Get this: because we can learn how to play chess. Learning, most of us would agree, is one of those fundamentals of intelligence. So can we produce a computer that can learn chess?', 'Well, just maybe we can. In early December, chess and AI circles began buzzing with news of the feats of AlphaZero, a chess-playing program developed by Google?s AI wing, DeepMind. And of AlphaZero, you could certainly say it had learnt the game.', 'More correctly, it learnt how to play the game well. For to begin with, it was given the bare-bones rules of chess?the way knights move, the way castling happens, etc.?and no more. In that limited sense, it knew how to play chess. But it had no notion of strategies that human players use, nor of the relative values of pieces that invariably figure in human assessments of a given situation in the game. Just the rules, and then AlphaZero set to work playing itself again and again. Not just once or twice, but some 40 million times. In the process, it taught itself how to play the game, better and better all the time. This is a process AI researchers call ?reinforcement learning?.', 'The results were stunning. After just four hours of training itself this way under its belt, AlphaZero was sent into battle against a program called Stockfish. Now, Stockfish is the 2016 winner of the Top Chess Engine Championship, effectively the world championship of computer chess. Take Kasparov, Vishwanathan Anand, Bobby Fischer, Tigran Petrosian, Magnus Carlsen, any of the great champions of chess through history?Stockfish would handily beat every one of them. That?s how strong it is.', 'Stockfish and AlphaZero played 100 games. AlphaZero won 28 of those, 72 were drawn and Stockfish won precisely zero games. Stunning. Interestingly, 25 of those 28 wins came with AlphaZero playing white, which underlines what chess experts have always believed: there is an advantage that making the first move?which white does?gives you.', 'What?s more, AlphaZero played in a distinctly different style from either Stockfish or humans. As Demis Hassabis, CEO of DeepMind, remarked: ?It doesn?t play like a human, and it doesn?t play like a program. It plays in a third, almost alien, way.? It played what one article described as an ?all-out attacking style?, often apparently throwing out the window any caution a human might observe, sometimes making head-scratching but spectacular sacrifices of valuable pieces to gain an advantage in position. Strange, and yet the results spoke for themselves. If AlphaZero?s unorthodox style was going to win so overwhelmingly, perhaps there are lessons about how we have always played the game. Perhaps even lessons about how we learn. About intelligence itself.', 'It?s worth pointing out here that AlphaZero should not really be considered a chess program. It?s more like a learning machine. Given a basic set of rules, it can teach itself to play any other game too. In fact, a slightly different version of the program learnt to play Go, the Japanese board game that?s far more complicated than chess. Then it beat the program that had beaten the human Go world champion?not once or twice, but one hundred times in a row.', 'More generally, AlphaZero?s creators believe they can make their learning machine learn how to tackle tasks that have nothing to do with chess or other games. Finance, drug-testing and more ? in other words, wherever it is possible to spell out some basic rules. Whether this is really correct, we?ll have to wait and see. But meanwhile, AlphaZero has shown that computers can learn. Maybe not in the way that we humans do, but learn nevertheless.', 'And that has some profound implications for AI. Maybe for intelligence itself.', 'Once a computer scientist, Dilip D?Souza now lives in Mumbai and writes for his dinners.', 'His Twitter handle is @DeathEndsFun']"

The inadequacy of our present infrastructure, however, cannot be an excuse for creating a below-par infrastructure that is in frequent need of repair or upgrades.', 'In fact, the current government?s focus on transforming infrastructure, which includes housing for all and smart cities, presents an unprecedented opportunity to build or upgrade existing urban and civil infrastructure that is world-class in terms of efficiency and safety.', 'To do so, we need to first reorient our construction goals and commit to performance metrics that emphasize safety, efficiency and longevity of infrastructure projects as much as the speed and time of project completion. Once these metrics are in place, the actual execution is relatively straightforward?with judicious application of specialized technology in constructing or maintaining the infrastructure.', 'Consider the example of roads, where right grading and compacting (using a road roller) of the surface before and after road construction makes all the difference between producing a road surface that is smooth, wobble-free and lasts for years versus one that is undulated, gets water logged and withers away in the first heavy rain. Advanced machine-control technologies available today allow global positioning system (GPS)-enabled precise and automated control of hydro-mechanical components of construction equipment for highly accurate grading and compacting. Contrast this with manual compacting that involves little precision for the person driving the road roller, and depends solely on his instinct or skill to determine how many times the surface should be rolled. In fact, once the grading and road-rolling equipment is automated and remotely controlled, precise values fed into the system are able to create safer and durable world-class roads.', 'In case of railway infrastructure, which is in dire need of an upgrade, safety is perhaps an even more critical consideration. Derailments, which in turn are frequently caused by fractures in railway lines, have been responsible for more than half of 586 railway accidents in the last five years, according to a 20 August report inHindustan Times. Today, we have sensors that can continually monitor track movement in real time and raise alerts in case of any cracks or abnormality, thus allowing the signalling room to stop the train and prevent a derailment. When deployed on flood-prone roads and bridges, these sensors can raise alerts to slow down or restrict rail or road traffic?or stop it altogether in case of a grave threat.', 'Structural monitoring is useful when new metro lines or flyovers are being added in congested areas; but it is more critical in the vicinity of many old or heritage buildings (as is the case in Mumbai today), or in case of dilapidated buildings in seismically active places like in Delhi. Every monsoon, dozens of old or dilapidated buildings collapse in cities across India. Imagine how many lives could be saved if our municipalities mandated the use of structural monitoring systems in buildings older than a prescribed age and evacuate their occupants well in time when the sensors raise an alert?', 'These monitoring systems typically consist of high resolution strong motion recorders (to detect seismic activity), total stations (electronic/optical instruments used in modern surveying and building construction) and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers feeding data into an advanced monitoring software solution. They can also detect minute changes in a building?s structural and position parameters due to tunnelling or digging and can help the authorities ensure that existing buildings stand their ground unmoved by the vibrations.', 'For example, in the US, the California Strong Motion Instrumentation Program (CSMIP) records the strong shaking of the ground and structures during earthquakes through a state-wide network of strong motion instruments?California being the most seismically active of all the 50 US states. CSMIP maintains recording instruments at more than 1,150 locations state-wide, including the city halls of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Oakland, and at the State Capitol.

Similar systems monitor buildings, including prestigious landmarks in Australia and New Zealand, including Te Puna o Waiwhetu, Christchurch?s main art gallery, which is otherwise designed to withstand earthquakes.', 'The contrast with India is stark, however, as we have collectively often neglected infrastructure safety.

Coupled with the bring your own device, or BYOD, trend in offices, the number of connected devices is forecast to reach over 30 billion globally by 2020, according to research firm IHS Markit Ltd. Experts opine that this connectivity boom will only increase the security risk for companies.', '?Those same devices (desktops, laptops, smartphones, routers, etc.) also access other open networks and who knows from where a ?bad actor? can inject a piece of malware into the device? Soon, the same piece of malware can be injected into the enterprise network,? cautioned Partha Narasimhan, chief technology officer of networking firm Aruba Networks Inc.?a unit of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co.?in a recent interview in New Delhi.', 'Enterprise network security has evolved from just a ?perimeter solution? in the wake of the BYOD and IoT trends, Narasimhan insisted. ?Wi-Fi broke that physical perimeter paradigm, because signals tend to leak outside the building,? he explained. ?Equipment like security cameras and home routers continue to have default or factory settings that can open up the threat surface,? Narasimhan pointed out.', 'Many companies currently use mobile device management (MDM) solutions, which separate and secure business-critical data on employees? personal mobiles, to address their security needs. However, these can protect companies ?only to some extent?, according to Narasimhan, because of the complexities associated with how much control users would allow the company on their devices and whether the required security policies can be enforced.', 'According to Narasimhan, today?s security issues can be solved through the use of big data analytics and machine learning (ML)?a subset of artificial intelligence (AI). These technologies, he opined, can help chief information officers (CIOs) and chief information security officers (CISOs) reduce the number of ?false alerts? in security logs by looking at data in a context and analysing it from multiple angles. ?ML algorithms can learn a user?s behaviour over time and do not have to be taught about what is acceptable user behaviour,? he said.', 'Additionally, said Narsimhan, there are tech tools available to derive insights from data held in routers, switches and other networking equipment. ?We have been focusing a lot on leveraging the network as a sensor and analysing the data that comes out of the infrastructure,? he said, insisting that this can help CIOs and CISOs address the challenges of complexity and security resulting from the BYOD and IoT trends.', 'Analysing network data has multiple benefits, he said, including ?user experience? management. ?The user expectation is that the network is always there and whenever this expectation is not met, the network is said to be ?broken? but there can be different issues,? he said. According to him, it can be a Wi-Fi issue, a device problem or even something to do with the physical building where the user is located.', 'Identifying and fixing these issues is important to keep a company?s network in good shape and meet the future needs of users, according to Narasimhan. He said that using advanced network analytics tools, it is now possible to identify the problem and ?proactively alert? the network administrators that if they don?t do something about it for, say, another six months, they are going to ?hit a wall?.', 'Tech tools can also enable CIOs and CISOs spot anomalies for potential security threats. Also, data from the network can also give companies an indication of how well they are utilizing the physical space.', 'Industry experts concur that the growing connectivity of devices is indeed multiplying the security risks for companies. Jaspreet Singh, partner, information security at consulting firm EY, opines that in a connected scenario--in the upcoming smart cities, for instance?even a small slip-up in security can lead to chaos or catastrophic situations. ?Imagine that you are driving in your car and the navigation system is connected to the traffic signalling system which, in turn, is connected to the traffic police and other civic authorities. So, even a minor glitch in the signalling system can lead to chaos on the roads.? On their part, he said, companies need to assess the security risks across the entire network and put in customized solutions that best fit their individual needs.', 'By 2020, more than 25% of identified attacks in enterprises will involve the IoT, although the IoT will account for less than 10% of IT security budgets, according to research firm Gartner Inc. IoT, according to a Gartner e-book titledLeading the IoT(gtnr.it/2E2WlLu), ?will expand rapidly and extensively, continually surfacing novel and unforeseen opportunities and threats?, calling for a ?new type of CIO, a ?CIO of everything?, who can radically adapt their vision, decision making and capabilities to orchestrate an IoT world?.', 'Besides, the complex nature of IoT and lack of standards can also be a hindrance to effective security. Dilip Sarangan, IoT research director at Frost and Sullivan, a research firm, recently said (bit.ly/2mzCxXV), because the responsibility for IoT security is diffused across device manufacturers, network providers, software developers and many others, it is difficult for the industry to make progress on all-encompassing standards.', 'Narasimhan acknowledged the existence of these issues and said companies need to be cognizant of the growing security risks and work towards mitigating them. ?My advice would be to use a combination of solutions that gives them visibility into as well as control over their networks,? he said.

Through hashtags, short videos, tweets, blog posts and the creative use of social media, the campaign called ?#Digital Hifazat? is seeking to raise awareness about the recent but rampant, phenomenon of online harassment and the problem with existing legislation.', 'The #Digital Hifazat campaign was the winner of the SM4E awards in the ?Online Safety? category, organized by the Digital Empowerment Foundation in 2017.', 'It was initiated by a digital magazine, Feminism in India (FII), which focuses on the feminist perspective on issues ranging from sexuality, violence and body image to health, sports and science. This gender-oriented platform was started in 2013 by 28-year-old Delhi-based researcher and writer Japleen Pasricha.', 'The movement has sought to raise awareness about cyber harassment by crowd-sourcing articles and online content from followers and writers on experiences of online abuse, provide legal analysis of cybercrime prevention laws in India, and suggests steps towards making the Internet safe, secure and accessible. FII publishes articles on image-based sexual abuse (revenge porn), online abuse, laws that help victims of cybercrimes and cyber violence against women on social media and online dating apps, the need for women to reclaim the Internet, and feminist principles of the Internet.', '?We published deeply-researched articles each day of our month-long campaign, which were shared widely on social media and received a lot of engagement from our audience,? says Pasricha.', 'The idea for the #Digital Hifazat,? Pasricha says, came after she was commissioned to write a report on cyber violence against women in India by US-based NGO Freedom House. After the report was published, she used the findings to design the campaign in late 2016.', '?Online VAW is still a new form of violence globally and especially in India, and not many women?s rights NGOs in India work on it. Being a digital-only platform and an organization that faces online harassment almost daily, it became important for us to take up this issue and work extensively on it,? she notes.', 'Cyber harassment includes stalking, offending a person online with unwanted sexually explicit messages, and threats of violence or hate speech. The most disturbing form of online violence is non-consensual pornography.', 'Research shows that an estimated one in 10 women globally have already experienced some form of cyber violence since the age of 15.', 'According to a 2015 UN report,?Cyber Violence against Women and Girls: a Worldwide Wake-Up Call?, online violence is just as lethal to women as physical violence, and has warned that women are growing even more vulnerable to cyber violence as internet access spreads to more areas. It estimates that 73% of women have endured cyber violence, and that women are 27 times more likely than men to be harassed online.', 'Pasricha?s report also found that women in India have trouble thinking about the attacks they experience on social media platforms as ?violent?, and are likely to ignore or block their assailants. Many lacked awareness of their legal rights as victims of cyber stalking and other crimes.', 'FII has been actively using all the three major social media channels?Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?to reach a wider audience for its campaign. Pasricha underlines that social media is an intrinsic part of the organization, as it is the main way in which it disseminates daily content.', '?Our expertise in social media has also led us to conduct training and workshops on social media management for NGOs, NPOs and social enterprises,? she says.', 'The digital magazine draws maximum engagement from Facebook, where FII has over 41,000 likes.', 'On its page, FII shares a variety of multimedia content including posts, images, and short and engaging videos. It usually schedules 7-8 posts daily, with short write-ups of articles and a thumbnail link to them. It also uses Facebook to share info-graphics and posters about campaigns and to mobilise the writers? community.', 'On Twitter, a dynamic two-way engagement is generated. FII has over 12,000 followers on this micro-blogging site. On Instagram, where FII has about 2200 followers, it shares behind-the-scenes photos and videos from its office space, and advocacy campaigns.', '?Most of the feminist media websites available online were American. I wanted to make feminist content, which the young people will read and consume using pop culture and social media. I also wanted it to be free and accessible knowledge in terms of language,? she says.', 'Despite the impact, Pasricha highlights, FII has had difficulty in finding partners willing to pay for digital media services irrespective of the massive outreach it promises.', 'Also, recognizing that most of its writers belong to a privileged section of the society, FII is actively seeking out voices from marginalized communities and aims to diversify its writers? pool.', '?We also plan to engage college youth this year with workshops and (a) campus ambassador program,? she marks.', 'Minthas a strategic partnership with Digital Empowerment Foundation, which hosts the Manthan and mBillionth awards.']"

Edited excerpts:', 'Toyota is seen in the market as an anti-electric vehicle (EV) company. Why are you averse to bringing the technology to India?', 'We make more than one-and-a-half million electric vehicles in the world but I think it?s the wrong thing for India. Our long-term requirements are better fuel efficiency because we need to reduce oil imports, a cleaner environment and more safety. These three things are needed to survive long-term in the mobility game. Look at all the studies on emissions and efficiency. You can reduce energy consumption if the overall system is more efficient.', 'Data from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, based on Indian driving cycles, fuel systems and electricity production, shows that hybrids are the most efficient for the environment and energy consumption. While India?s capacity to produce electricity from renewable sources is about 70%, actual production is about 90% coal-based. On that basis, EVs produce far more emissions than a hybrid. While I fully agree that we have to reduce dependence on oil imports, it may soon happen that we start to depend on lithium imports. We need to decide if we want to deal with the Chinese or the Arabs?', 'Each country has its own energy profile. For example, in Norway, electricity is mostly produced from hydropower. Therefore, EVs are a fantastic option for them.', 'EVs could have been a good option if our electricity was entirely generated from nuclear or hydropower. With India?s current energy profile, hybrid is the best option. We can have numerous policies, but finally, what makes economic sense for the country will pan out. We will pursue hybrid.', 'A hybrid is basically an EV with a smaller battery than a full EV; it is much more complex. The customers will finally drive what is sold. They are intelligent enough to understand what is happening with the environment. As more data comes in, they will know what is the right way to go.', 'So, it?s not that we won?t do electric. Hybrids will still have an electric motor and can run on them a 100%. I have a new Lexus LS500h which can be fully electric on the highway if you put a larger battery.', 'So have you been able to convey this to the government?', 'We are trying our best. As the government is seeing more scientific engineering data, they are starting to understand. Let me put it the other way. The government is saying they want 30% of vehicles to be electric in the next 15-20 years. The industry said fine, and they will be a part of that. What happens to the remaining 70%? That?s still six million vehicles.', 'The oil ministry has started expanding refineries because they anticipate more requirement for petrol and diesel. If you really want to reduce that requirement, these (hybrids) consume 50% lesser fuel.', 'Take all that data and take a call on it. Now it?s becoming evangelical in the sense that it must be done because I (the government) have said it must.', 'The industry is also divided into parts: a set of companies that want electric and others that do not.', 'A part of the problem is that 90% of hybrid technology, in terms of production, is with Toyota.', 'Most of the other manufacturers are licensees of Toyota?s. To some extent, some people in the government think that if they support hybrids, they?re supporting only one company. The government needs to decide if they are supporting a technology or a given intent. Is your intent to reduce oil import or to focus on one technology? Don?t tell us what technology to use; it should be technology-agnostic.', 'Additionally, put a glide slope for oil import and emission; if you?re below it, incentivize and if above, penalize.

Toyota and Suzuki have announced they?ll make EVs in Gujarat.', 'Is Toyota Kirloskar Motor involved in that partnership?', 'No. But we?ll find out soon enough about how that?s developing.

There is no technical difference between that and a Camry or a Corolla, no high-end features have been taken away.', 'What can we expect from Toyota Kirloskar Motor in the next five to seven years?', 'As a company, we?ve been working hard on reducing our carbon footprint. We don?t use freshwater for production for over 10 months of the year. We are looking to make our company good for the country. You?ll see more on environment and safety from the company.', 'And, once in a while, there will be regulation changes?', 'The strategy we?ve adopted in the past several years, for example in terms of safety, is to stay ahead of regulation. For this, I must give credit to Toyota. The same best-in-class safety standards apply to their cars no matter where they sell them.', 'What?s the update with Lexus?', 'Sales have just begun with the whole range up for sale. They are priced quite high, but there is still a market for such vehicles. It shows the level of technology which we can aspire to have in all our cars, within Toyota.

Jaitley argued.', 'Elaborating on the contentious 10% LTCG tax on equity investments proposed in the finance bill, Jaitley said it was to correct an anomaly whereby the incentives were unfairly skewed towards high net-worth entities and individuals.', '?Exempted income from long-term capital gains last year was Rs3.67 trillion. Some are small investors. So we said up to Rs1 lakh of capital gains, there will be no tax. The other investors are large corporate houses, foreign investors, high net-worth individuals and limited liability partnerships.

Has there been a two percentage point fall in GDP in the next year (2017-18)? This year, we are assumed to grow at 6.7%. The difference is 40 basis points. This is also because of GST,?

Just last month, Singapore Exchange Ltd (SGX) told investors it had garnered a 52% share of global Nifty futures volumes, up from 47% a year ago. And combined with Dubai Gold and Commodities Exchange (DGCX), offshore centres have nearly caught up with Indian exchanges in dollar-rupee trading.', 'Encouraged by the success, SGX has launched futures contracts on 50 leading Indian stocks since 5 February. A big factor that works in its favour is Singapore?s taxation policy, which exempts capital gains tax and doesn?t impose a securities transaction tax (STT). In contrast, India now has the rare distinction of imposing both forms of taxation.', 'While offshore centres have become increasingly attractive to trade Indian assets, the irony is that they haven?t done anything spectacular to attract order flow. Thanks to a number of policy missteps, India has been gifting its financial market to centres such as SGX one product at a time.Last year, a flawed policy on the use of participatory notesdrove away overseas participants to offshore centres. This year?s contribution is flawed tax policy.', 'Arvind Virmani, a former chief economic advisor in the finance ministry says, ?Without tax economists who can analyse the effect of different taxes on incentives, efficiency and equity, we are doomed to stumble from one tax mistake to another.? The government hasn?t employed tax economists for years now, which isleading to mistakes in other areas as well.', 'J.R. Varma, a professor of finance at IIM Ahmedabad, says, ?Over the last decade or more, tax policy has become primarily focused on revenue generation with too little attention to either fairness or economic efficiency.?', 'The government?s stance that exempting LTCG on equities is inequitable, especially when all other asset classes are taxed, is just one part of the picture?the revenue generation part. It brushes aside the double taxation argument against LTCG, for one. Urjit Patel, governor of Reserve Bank of India, even says that equity capital is taxed as many as five times in India, and that this can have an impact on investment decisions. Patel, incidentally, was part of the Vijay Kelkar task force on direct taxesthat had recommended abolishing LTCG to avoid double taxation.', 'The fact that it works against the interests of India?s financial markets is another important aspect to consider. ?STT is a tax on transactions and disincentivises transactions. Transactions will move to other jurisdictions if this is possible and if the cost of doing so is less than the cost of STT. This is perfectly predictable. The 10% LTCG will increase the incentive to shift trading to other jurisdictions,? points out Virmani.', 'Does this mean the government is oblivious of the international implications of changes in taxation policy or is it just giving the threat from offshore centres a nonchalant shrug? Not quite. It has a plan B to bring back volumes from offshore centres.', 'While trading in the mainland exchanges has become more taxing, the government has brought exchanges situated in international financial services centres (IFSCs) on par with offshore centres. Traders in these exchanges were already exempt from STT and LTCG; in last week?s budget, the finance minister also waived short-term capital gains taxes.', 'From the looks and sound of it, NSE and BSE will primarily rely on their exchanges running out of the IFSC in Gift City to win back volumes from offshore centres. ?Gift City has the solutions to some of the problems that drove volumes offshore,? says an exchange official. This is bizarre, to say the least. It?s worse than sending your B team to the World Cup. ?Gandhinagar is not seen as a financial centre; and people want to work in a financial centre where all linkages such as law firms etc. are in place,? says the head of one of India?s largest trading firms.', 'He adds that just as the IFSC in Dubai is an extension of the existing marketplace in the city, an IFSC that worked as an extension of the markets in Mumbai would have been far more viable.', 'In any case, relying on plan B or team B is flawed thinking, because this effectively means that India?s main markets will continue to get hollowed out. Whether traders use SGX or an exchange in Gift City, the fact remains that exchanges in the mainland will be hurt. Of course, since most domestic retail investors don?t have access to either offshore centres or IFSCs, existing markets won?t be completely hollowed out. And as they did with STT, some trading firms will build the additional cost into their models and move on. But liquidity can weaken over time, which will hurt price discovery.', 'One big worry with a policy stance that promotes IFSCs is that there will be no urgency to fix the gaps in the mainstay markets. Another concern related to their promotion is what the next course of action could be if tax incentives don?t do the trick. If, for instance, regulatory oversight is not maintained at stringent levels, with a view to attract order flow, it will be a huge disaster in the making. As argued in this column earlier, a far more practical alternative is to strengthen India?s existing markets. The fact that the government seems to be doing the opposite shows that it?s time to heed Virmani?s call and bring back tax economists into the policy making process.']"

Questioning one of the key highlights of the budget, which the government has projected as a pro-farmer measure, Ramesh stated that while it has been said that the MSP would be set at 50% above the cost, it had not been made clear what would be the criterion for deciding the cost of production.', 'The cost varied according to the method chosen, he said referring to a newspaper interview by a Niti Aayog functionary, he said it appeared that the promise made by the finance minister Arun Jaitley was the government?s ?jumla number one?.', 'He also claimed that insufficient funds were allocated for the health insurance scheme. Ramesh claimed the scheme would anyway benefit private hospitals rather than the public. It is being touted as ?ModiCare?, he said.', 'Taking a jibe, he said by this logic AIIMS may be called an institute of ?Modical? sciences. Ramesh said that an insurance scheme existed during the UPA tenure and only the money had been increased. It was a work in continuation, he claimed.', 'A former Union minister, Ramesh, said that a health assurance approach would have been better than an insurance scheme as past experience has demonstrated. He said the budgetary allocation required for the scheme was somewhere between 12,000 crore to 1 lakh crore but a grossly insufficient Rs2,000 crore had been allocated.', 'He termed the scheme as ?NAMO, or no allocation, messaging only?. On jobs front, Ramesh said the government was focussing on the EPFO figures to estimate jobs created, which he claimed was a wrong approach. He said the raise in provident fund accounts had happened as there was formalisation of the informal sector due to GST and demonetisation. Even as this was a beneficial result of these two measures, he said exaggerated claims related to job creation were being made based on EPFO data, he said.', '?To say all these jobs are new, would be completely wrong,? Ramesh said seeking to punch holes in the government?s claims on employment. He said recent comments by the chief economic advisor had also indicated the same.', 'Referring to BJP member Subramanian Swamy, he said the senior leader had recently stated there was pressure on the central statistical organisation to present data in such a way that it appears there was no unfavourable impact of GST and demonetisation.', 'He also questioned the government?s claims on ease of doing business and said the rise in India?s rankings was only courtesy a change criterion used for measuring the performance of various countries. The government was, however, presenting it as some sort of miracle, he said.', 'He said that thought India had moved upwards, it was only due to the new insolvency law that was brought in. These measures, however, encourage a hire and fire policy towards employees, he said. Ramesh accused the government of making exaggerated claims on issues like job creation. Following Ramesh?s speech, BJP member Mahesh Poddar and SP leader Neeraj Shekhar also spoke.', 'The discussion will continue tomorrow. Earlier, after Rajeev Chandrashekhar (Independent) had spoken, the Chair called Ramesh to move the debate on the Budget further. Ramesh said the Budget was ?unusual and historic? because soon after its presentation, the Prime Minister came on deferred live telecast to decode the Budget.', 'Normally, he said that after Budget, the prime minister congratulate his finance minister for its presentation. Before he could continue, members from the treasury benches objected to the comments. This lead to heated arguments between BJP and Congress. Some other opposition members too supported the Congress.', 'The Chair tried to pacify the two sides, but in vain. The House was adjourned for 10 minutes. When the House reassembled, Ramesh continued his speech. In the meanwhile, C. M. Ramesh of TDP and three of his party colleagues entered the Well carrying placards. They were also shouting slogans.', 'The Chair asked them to return to seats but in vain. Deputy chairman Bhubaneswar Kalita asked Ramesh to continue his speech even as TDP members were raising slogans. Ramesh said he could not speak amid the din and got support from other opposition members also.', 'Minister of state for parliamentary affairs Vijay Goel urged the protesting members to return to seats. However, they did not yield. The Chair adjourned the House for another 10 minutes. When the House met again, there was ruckus and another adjournment followed.', 'When the House met again, the protesting TDP members again came to the Well. Opposition members asked the Chair to bring the House in order. But as the stalemate continued, the Chair adjourned the Rajya Sabha for 30 minutes for dinner. It was at the next assembling of the House that Ramesh managed to complete his speech.']"

This is the only line which is not a joke in this act, which had garnered 7,304,809 views on YouTube when I watched it earlier this week. I peer closely at the number to make sure it is actually 7.3 million. After all the jokes about the shape, size, song and even the groping of breasts on Mumbai?s locals, Mittal leaves the audience with a single takeaway. A heightened awareness of the risk of breast cancer.', 'I?ve been chatting, texting and talking to Aditi Mittal for over a year now. Sometimes we are friends exchanging notes, sometimes I am interviewing her, and most of the time I am trying to join the dots. What makes Mittal, one of India?s most popular stand-up comics with her own hour-long Netflix show, so preposterous and yet so resonant with audiences? She locates her jokes in the most uncomfortable moments in one?s life, and makes us laugh. And then think.', 'We have spoken about mothers who have the same one-liners and brothers we get along with best when they are a few continents removed from us.', '?In a clean, straightforward way, you exist in the years between my daughters and me,? I type in the chat window, trying to articulate my fascination with observing Mittal. Even more than her performances, I watch her off-stage, keenly following her outspoken, self-deprecatory avatar on Twitter and Facebook. I also sense a vulnerability and want to reach there with her.', '?What I love about my job is how it makes me live for a living. I have to reallylive, and immerse myself so I have something authentic to talk about on stage,?

That?s my best preparation.?', 'In the middle of last year, Mittal?s father died after a brief illness. I send her a message a few days later. ?I want to fly to wherever you are and laugh and cry with you a little.?', 'She gets back after a few hours. ?No crying,? she says. ?He outclassed everyone else in death. So laughing is all that is left in this life.?', 'I send her a red heart emoticon in the chat window. She replies with two words. ?True story.?', '?I believe you, Aditi,?

Her older brother and she have been brought up jointly by her aunt, a single woman, and her father, who never married again. The children had two homes to call their own. Mittal refers to her aunt as Mom, and her stage acts are full of jokes at her expense.', '?My Mom?s mad, she is never pleased with anything,? Mittal tells me. ?I hope I never please her fully. I don?t know what a look of approval looks like, and I don?t want to see it either.?', '?But children usually resent this in their parents,? I say.', '?My Mom?s too funny. She doesn?t give a hoot. After she saw my first performance, her friend had so much feedback and praise for me. But Mom was just like, let?s leave quickly, we don?t want our car to be stuck in traffic now. Mom taught me to bebindaas(carefree),? says Mittal. ?Sometimes when my friends say, my Mom loved your show, that?s the best badge of honour for me.?', 'On another day, we chat about the use of personal stories in our work. ?I am fascinated by truth-tellers,? says Mittal. ?There are people whose work makes me pause and say, oh, he or she has revealed this also?

They don?t want to seem seductive to anyone any more. I was inspired to create the character of Dr Mrs Lutchuke from watching this grandmom, who could chase you down the street if she wanted something from you. This character, with bad posture and a worse mood, allowed me to say so much on stage. I didn?t have to be Aditi Mittal saying outrageous things. I could step into the skin of the crazy Lutchuke woman and distance myself from her behaviour. It?s a fascinating device.?', 'I tell her that whether she cares to accept it or not, she is a role model too. It is inspiring to watch a young, single woman going on stage to perform comedy, using her body, her voice and her words to draw laughter without fear of ridicule. Stating grand truths with a lightness of touch, so the laughs come first and the shock of the revelation settles in later.', '?Raise the standard of your role models, Miss,? Mittal says in her inimitable way. ?Performing stand-up comedy is like an adventure sport,? she adds. ?No two situations are ever the same. You can bungee-jump 10 times to practise, but the risk remains the same each time you perform. If you do badly, you die.', '?There is a symbiotic relationship between the writing of the material and the performing of it. One informs the other. You are under duress when you are performing, you have to be in the moment and adapt according to the energy in that space.?', 'Mittal has a busy schedule and a full calendar. In the last two years, she has debuted at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, presented a show calledA Beginner?s Guide To Indiaon BBC?s Radio 4, released her Netflix comedy special,Things They Wouldn?t Let Me Say,and performed multiple shows every week. She performed 168 shows in 2017, adding new destinations like Hubli, Visakhapatnam, Guwahati, Shillong, Lucknow and Raipur in her itinerary.', '?Shillong was my best audience,? she says. ?Work makes me meet new people and places all the time. I am always learning from watching responses. What made them laugh? What didn?t? Sometimes the late realization on someone?s face?it?s thrilling to observe faces from the stage.?', '?Where do you want to reach?? I ask Mittal. I want to know what seems like the pinnacle of achievement to a stand-up comic.', '?By the mathematical odds, I feel like I have already won a lottery,? she says. ?I am too lucky. Just the fact that I get to do this on a consistent basis is a win for me.? After a pause, she adds, ?I want to do this till I am 90.?', '?Till Dr Mrs Lutchuke and you become the same person,? I say. She laughs at the thought, giving me the thrill of having seemed funny to a comedian again.', 'Because I am so aware of my own inhibitions and roadblocks, I am keen to hear about the fears Mittal grapples with. ?The only way to it, is through it,? she often repeats in our conversations.', '?Naak pakad ke kood jaao(Hold your nose and jump in).

According to analysts, while net interest income, difference between interest earned, is seen under pressure because of lower loan growth, cut in deposit rates in the third quarter is likely to be supportive. Non-interest income is also seen down because muted treasury income as yields on government bonds rose sharply in the December quarter.', 'Loan growth:After a period of sluggishness, system loan growth has started reviving and touched the 10% mark in December. SBI?s outlook on the loan growth trend and projection for current and next fiscal year would be keenly awaited, especially in the light of recapitalisation of public sector bank.

0,livemint,Leisure,02-09-2018 14:35,Manu Pillai,The Kamasutra in the #MeToo Age,"['Kamasutra', 'Vatsyayan', 'Erotica', 'Sex', '#MeToo']",There is more to the classic manual on love and sex than bedroom antics,"['In 1883, when theKamasutrafirst made its appearance in English, European readers of Vatsyayana?s treatise hadn?t the faintest idea that its publisher?the Hindoo Kama Shastra Society?was, in fact, an entirely non-existent body. Ostensibly headquartered in Varanasi, with links to London and New York, the ?Society? was actually a work of fiction, born from the minds of a couple of British officials and their associates in faraway India. That the translation, despite its infirmities, was indeed of Vatsyayana?s 1,600-year-old disquisition was not doubted. But even as theKamasutramade its way into the great libraries of the West, the true identity of its translator remained shrouded for years behind this fictitious organization. There were several reasons why Sir Richard Francis Burton was paranoid about advertising his name with the book?British laws on obscenity were so draconian that printing anything even vaguely sexual could show writers the doors to prison. For theKamasutra, then, it took some creative thinking to evade Victorian prudery. The Sanskrit wordyoniwas used in the English text for the vagina, even when Vatsyayana himself never used that word in the actual Sanskrit original. But the gamble paid off?in time, the bogus Kama Shastra Society?s translation would become, as one scholar notes, ?one of the most pirated books in the English language?, registered across the world as the oldest and foremost classical text on all matters pertaining to love and human sexuality. This, even when it wasn?t exactly sincere to Vatsyayana?s moral outlook from centuries before.', 'The loosely held opinion that theKamasutrais a catalogue for boudoir gymnastics also owes much to this context: The pronounced disapproval with which topics around sexuality were viewed meant that its most colourful components acquired, ironically, a life of their own, feelings of taboo fuelling a mischievous appetite for the text. In actual fact, though, theKamasutrais more than a manual for love-making?of the seven books that constitute its body, only the second is strictly concerned with methods of human congress. Burton, bent as he was on ?the sexual liberation of Victorian society?, seems to have highlighted these while watering down other elements. But despite such interventions, even in that first 1883 translation, of 175-odd pages, Burton could devote only 40 to this theme. The remainder of theKamasutra, in fact, offers a much wider series of discussions for the benefit of its wealthy and primarily male audience, covering not only sex but also matters of aesthetics and more.', 'Book 5, for example, concerns itself with extramarital affairs and how one ought to go about getting in bed with another?s spouse, while another section in the same book investigates, tantalizingly but ultimately disappointingly, ?Why Women Get Turned Off?. In Book 1, we learn that if men of culture want to remain men of culture, they must allocate time every five-10 days to the removal of all their body hair. Married women are generally not to be seduced, we are taught, but if it helps to gain influence over a powerful husband or even perhaps to erase him from the world and acquire his wealth, it is acceptable to bed the wife as a weapon for one?s personal ambitions and avarice. In these sections, then, theKamasutramight well have been inspired by cold, calculating Chanakya and his utterly pragmaticArthashastra.', '', 'The writer Hanif Kureishi once similarly noted that theKamasutrais less like Lord Byron?s heady romances and closer to P.G. Wodehouse?s wit in much of its tone. ?One can wager on kisses,? argues Vatsyayana, for ?whichever of the partners first gets to the other?s lower lip wins.? In order to seduce a woman, a man must be prepared to go flower-picking with her, to play in her doll house, and, perhaps most essentially, cultivate her closest friend, who, in an ideal society, is her wet-nurse?s daughter. Where courtesans are concerned, Vatsyayana advises them to avoid by all means patrons with worms in their stool?or whose breath ?smells of crows?. They must also, he warns, never surrender reason, feeling free to manipulate men for money and goods. And if a patron were no longer capable, of providing said money and goods, he was to be discarded. One suggested route was to alienate him with markedly unpleasant behaviour: ?Curling the lip in a sneer? and ?stamping on the ground? promised success, evidently. ?Ignoring him? was also an option.', 'There are, however, parts of theKamasutrathat make for highly uncomfortable reading, especially in this time when #MeToo has sparked such troubled introspection; sections that, as scholar Wendy Doniger notes, seem to justify the seduction-by-sexual-assault school of thinking. So while one can laugh at theKamasutra?s assertion that the male ?instrument? (ideally pierced) smeared with honey, powdered thornapple and black pepper provides divine ecstasies to the female, one cannot quite digest that a man can confidently proceed with intercourse with a woman when ?her mouth says no, but her eyes say yes?. Where at one point he is clear that ?a girl who is asleep, weeping or absent? cannot be a bride, Vatsyayana still allows a wedding technique that involves getting the lady drunk, and taking her ?maidenhead? while she is unconscious. Of course, given its age and context, it is not surprising that theKamasutraspeaks in a male voice with erroneous male preconceptions. Compared to contemporaneous texts like theManusmriti, however, theKamasutrais replete with commentaries by women?and it recognizes the right to pleasure for the female too.', 'Vatsyayana?s approach to the third gender, on homosexuality and bisexuality, also makes for gripping reading (and interpretation), so that in the overall analysis of the work?a very good recent translation being A.N.D. Haksar?s?one feels partly surprised, partly amused, but always certainly interested. For all its sometimes outlandish views on life, marriage and intimacy, theKamasutraremains a thoroughly fascinating work of art and cultural heritage, one we must read for more than a mere list of bedroom positions. That, in the end, is the secret of its enduring appeal', 'Medium Rare is a column on society, politics and history. Manu S.

At around 10pm, we head to Sarafa, which has a completely different appearance from what I had witnessed in the daytime. The jewellery shops are shuttered and the entire street is lined with makeshift food stalls. Our first stop is right at the entrance of the market, a small shop in the corner sellinghare chhod(green gram) andbatle(green peas)ki kachori.

On a visit to the US last year, when I found out about an Italian food festival in Hoboken, New Jersey, I had to check it out for myself. Although I had tried a range of local cuisine during my stay in Italy, it was in the US that I had the zeppola for the very first time. These fluffy fried balls of dough, with a diameter of around 4 inches, are the Italian version of doughnuts.', 'At Hoboken, the zeppola stall was the only one with a really long line. After anxiously waiting for 30 minutes, we placed an order for two zeppole. The woman at the counter laughed and asked if I meant two dozen, because apparently that?s the measure in which it was being sold. After trying one from a set of 12, I was sold. I went back and queued up for another dozen.', 'This ?doughnut?, which originates in southern Italy, is usually topped with powdered sugar. It comes in different sizes and with a variety of fillings, such as custard, jelly, butter and honey, or ricotta with small pieces of chocolate, candied fruits and honey. There are savoury varieties of zeppole as well, filled with small fish such as anchovy, and commonly consumed in Calabria (south-west Italy) and the island nation of Malta. The savoury zeppole, apart from being shaped into balls, can also be stretched or twisted. The basic zeppola dough can be crisp, light and airy when made with puff pastry, or thicker and more bread-like when made with pizza dough.', 'There are Biblical references to this pastry. When Joseph fled to Egypt with Mary and baby Jesus, he began selling desserts, including the zeppole, to support his family. It was, however, in the early 19th century that zeppole were popularized by a baker named Pasquale Pintauro in Naples. Today, zeppole are widely available throughout southern Italy, including Rome, Naples, Sicily and Sardinia, as well as Malta and Croatia. Italian-American communities in Canada and the US also prepare this mouth-watering delicacy, especially during festivals such as the Festa di San Giuseppe (Saint Joseph?s Day) on 19 March, the Feast of San Gennaro, celebrated from 14-24 September, and around Christmas. In Calabria, people eat savoury zeppole on New Year?s Eve and New Year?s Day, and, in Malta, during Lent.', 'Zeppole are not all that common in Mumbai, but a chance discovery made me realize that I could easily make my own. While trawling through the internet for food delivery, I came across a recipe on the website of Foodhall, the gourmet food store. I have been eagerly looking forward to try my own version of the dessert since I found out that all the ingredients listed are easily available in my neighbourhood store. I was even more excited to learn that Francesco?s Pizzeria, a Mumbai-based eatery specializing in Italian cuisine, plans to add zeppole to its menu in the coming weeks. Davide Cananzi, Francesco?s consultant chef, has great memories of eating zeppole through a childhood spent in Sardinia. His version of the zeppole will be a simple fluffy pastry covered with a mix of sugar and cinnamon powder and topped with vanilla or chocolate custard.', 'A handful of Italian restaurants across the country serve this delicacy, including the Mumbai-based Gustoso, which makes a zeppole drizzled with Nutella, and Delhi Airport?s Radisson Blu Plaza, which offers the zeppole at its Italian-themed Sunday brunch.', 'Meanwhile, I am in the middle of perfecting my very own zeppole at home and introducing my friends and family to these delicious doughnuts without holes.']"

At 32, I still live alone and don?t cohabit with my partner, nor am I clinging to him until ?the one? comes along. I am happily unmarried and am part of a growing tribe of women who derive intellectual, romantic, sexual and spiritual pleasure from multiple sources. I?m not referencing polyamory, I mean to say our lives are not centred on the premise of one big love, a soulmate that ?completes? us.', 'I suppose this epiphany was too recent to have been internalized. It was delivered to me by a series of friends, the first provocation coming from Mandakini Gahlot, 33, a journalist and film-maker who is the India correspondent for France 24, on the morning after my sister?s wedding. She was recounting a conversation she?d had with our mutual friend the day before, about how she was currently basking in the understated glory of what she referred to as small loves. I remembered how, when Mandakini?s last relationship was ending, and she was manifesting a conditioned anxiety about never being coupled again, I had told her that she was the kind of powerful and intriguing woman who would have multiple lovers across state borders. And I had meant it. I had envisioned this utopic future for her not to appease her, but because I couldn?t imagine one man capable of loving as much of her as there was to fall in love with.', 'Soul desires', 'After this conversation, I started thinking about the hierarchies we have been programmed to create, between small loves and big loves. We confine love either to sexual entanglements, unrequited romances, or marriage. We sacrifice, through underestimation, the string of other loves that have imprinted themselves like seals on our hearts. As women, especially, we are taught to treat female friendships as subservient alliances, not as primary relationships. Yet I could argue that Mandakini has been one of the greatest, most fulfilling loves of my life, a constant, while also being the subject of my next memoir. In my dedication, I refer to her as my soulmate. And she is by no means the only one.', 'Was this legitimate? To have many loves, multiple soulmates, to wilfully not subscribe to the heteronormative notion of ?the one?. ?Of course it is legitimate? why not?? clinical psychologist Amrita Narayanan began her response to my question. ?There are so many bases on which to celebrate relationships, and longevity is just one of them. If you ask around, you might find many married people acknowledging that their One Great Love was someone they didn?t marry, meaning that they are using another index?in this case, intensity of romance?to define the ?most glorious relationship?,? says Narayanan, who is also the author of the short story collection, A Pleasant Kind Of Heavy And Other Erotic Stories, and the more recent, The Parrots Of Desire, an anthology surveying 3,000 years of Indian erotica.', '', 'In her opinion, what long-term relationships offer that short-term ones cannot, is continuity, ?which often is helpful not only in and of itself, but in having a continuous sense of identity?. On the other hand, short experiences offer newness, she says. This is what Dossie Easton, the author of The Ethical Slut, calls New Relationship Energy (NRE) and vitality, an important counter to sameness. ?I think if someone is successful without a soulmate or long-term love, it means they have been able to find (or maybe they struggle to find) a sense of continuity, and for people who insist on a soulmate, maybe newness gets sacrificed or has to be searched for more actively. Perhaps friends could fill in the gaps in both cases,? she says on email.', 'Another writer who has validated my preference for the solitude of singlehood, coupled with the plenitude of abundant intimate relationships, is the Chennai-based Sharanya Manivannan, author of the short story collection The High Priestess Never Marries, and a more recent book of poetry, The Altar Of The Only World. ?So many of us are single, often not by choice, but so few of us think about singleness as anything other than an aberration. We?re conditioned to expect, want and shortchange ourselves because of the belief that one person will complete it,? she says. Manivannan, 32, defines herself as someone who is both consciously as well as circumstantially single, ?which is to say I chose to interrogate my particular scenario and understand the structural reasons (mostly to do with gender inequality) that render me un-partnered?. She confesses that she does sometimes feel the absence of a partner, because she enjoys the intoxication of caring for a person in a particular way. But she never loses sight of how that is only one particular way to care, to love, or to have companionship. ?One enormous learning on my journey was that my significant others are the people I love, full stop. Romance and sex, let alone the contract of matrimony, need have nothing to do with it,? she adds.', 'Mumbai-based journalist and writer Anushree Majumdar, 33, whose Facebook status updates are rife with charming tales of her Tinder exploits, also does not subscribe to the belief in one perfect, ultimate soulmate. She identifies as consciously single, because she isn?t entirely convinced she has what it takes to be in a long-term, monogamous relationship. ?The thing I find myself saying the most to any lover, whether it is a one-night stand or somebody for a little longer, is, ?let?s just be kind to each other?. Because it?s the kindness and intimacy of a regular boyfriend or partner that I miss the most?. Each person in my inner circle (and in my bed) fulfils a certain role and need and I?m sure I do the same in their lives.?', 'Singular plural', 'Why it had taken me so long to arrive at this revelation about the legitimacy of loving in plural is anyone?s guess. It?s because conversations about non-monogamous relationships are still not mainstream, and, when they are, are often steeped in shame and secrecy. ?This is something my single friends and I talk about with each other, because we?re helping each other navigate the single life,? says Majumdar ?We?re all ballsy and privileged enough to live the way we want, but judgement can bite us if and when it comes our way, which it mostly does from married folks.?', 'I, for one, am fortunate to count my married friend, an executive editor at a leading literary publishing company, among my many loves. A week ago, I returned to our Airbnb at midnight after the Jaipur Literature Festival?s closing dinner at Amer Fort all excited because she was up after her long evening siesta. When I went upstairs, she and I sipped on Solan Number One as we lay in bed nursing the munchies in our PJs, watching back-to-back episodes of Sex And The City. We had enlightening conversations about each other?s ?number?, a reference to an episode in which one of the show?s characters, Miranda, has to list all her sexual partners since she has just found out that she has contracted chlamydia. As I was falling asleep, it dawned on me how the iconic series had ended, with Big looking Carrie Bradshaw in the eye on the Seine and saying, ?Carrie, you?re the one.? Even though the last scene of the finale showed her reunited with her besties in New York, her happily-ever-after was premised on Big?s declaration.', 'Would there ever be any equivalent cinematic ending for single women? Or is it that by virtue of being un-partnered, we must make do with the myth of the cat lady (incidentally, a scenario that caused Miranda much anxiety)? Could it not be possible that we are, in fact, already living our blisses, content not to expend our energies in futile search operations for one person to complete our complexity?', 'Why settle for the one when you can love so many?', 'Rosalyn D?Mello is the author of the erotic non-fiction memoir,A Handbook For My Lover,out in paperback this month by HarperCollins India.']"

She would tend to her duties as wife, mother and caretaker of the home, as she had been taught to do. Her world encompassed the colony she lived in, a slum which, as a microcosm of the city, provided her with all she needed by way of emotional and social interaction.', 'Little wonder, then, that she reacted with surprise when Radhika Kumari, who founded the Pink City Rickshaw Co. (PCRC) brigade, and her team of volunteers approached her with an idea. The PCRC is an initiative launched in practice last year by non-profit ACCESS Development Services, which works with women from marginalized backgrounds.', 'To Najma?s mind, the idea was outrageous. They wanted her, a woman well past 40, reclusive and unlettered, to not just step out into the world, but drive an electric autorickshaw on the tourist trail.', 'I heard Najma tell her story in December at a women at work conference in Jaipur, sitting sideways on stage, her face often hidden by herdupatta. Her voice was soft, almost hesitant and shy, but she told us of her journey from reluctant trainee to confident trainer.', 'Once convinced she could learn what others could, she braved the training programme to master the vehicle that would be her passport to self-reliance. The hurdles of language; of interacting with ?white men? and tourists; of facing the taunts of autorickshaw drivers who felt women had no place in their domain?she overcame these one at a time. As her confidence and expertise grew, Najma was chosen to train newer recruits.', 'Like Najma, Anita Mahawar also drives tourists around Jaipur for 4 hours a day. Mahawar, who shared the stage with Najma, is in her late 20s, has a master?s degree, and experience of working as a home guard at Amer Fort. She finds her work with the PCRC more lucrative and empowering. ?I told myself that if tourists can pay Rs1,100 for an elephant ride, they can pay us for a guided tour,? she said. She said she could shout right back when taxi drivers hurled taunts at her. And as I heard her on stage, I did not doubt that.', 'Najma and Mahawar are two of the 50 women who are part of the PCRC brigade. The project has taken time to plan, but it is their first tourist season, so issues are still being ironed out. They are trying to see what to do in the off season, i.e. the summer months.', 'Radhika Kumari, who heads the organization, is enthusiastic as she talks about the PCRC, an offering she believes can be replicated in other cities.', 'The autorickshaws, one of which stood outside the conference hall, are like roomy ?convertibles? that allow the canopy to be folded away on pleasant days. They are noiseless, and don?t emit the smoke or fumes commonly associated with three-wheel vehicles. The rickshaws come with ergonomically designed seats, mechanical improvements for greater safety, a locker for keeping clients? belongings safe, a mobile charger, a water bottle/newspaper holder and city maps.', '', 'The look and specifications was the easy part, Kumari says. Getting the women to wear distinctive uniforms to stand out among other auto-drivers was not. Kumari chipped away at the resistance, taking her trainees to a mall, where they saw women guards in uniform, and realized uniforms could impart both authority and individuality.', 'It would usually take 10 hours at the wheel for an autorickshaw driver to make a profit. To make it a workable idea for women who had to run homes and would not be able to spare so much time, the PCRC came up with four tourist routes. Four hours on any of these routes would enable the women not only to meet their personal expenses, but make a profit too. ACCESS underwrites the expense on uniforms, battery replacement and other maintenance issues.', 'The more ambitious ones can do two such trips on some days, adding to their earnings considerably. The profits depend on each woman?s initiative. In addition, as most of their clients are high-end foreign tourists, they automatically get tips of up to 20%.', 'The women learnt quickly and progressed from using sign language to speaking a smattering of foreign language words, as Najma manages to do. The tourists do their bit too, using language guides, and, by the end of the trip, both driver and rider are happy.', 'Kumari is now planning to allow customized tour options, as well as an app, IVRS, or interactive voice response, to help clients call and communicate with them.', 'Not surprisingly, despite Jaipur being perceived as a tradition-bound city, support has been forthcoming from many agencies. Niche hotels and travel companies recruit the services of these autorickshaw drivers in pink uniforms as part of their offering of out-of-the-usual experiences to clients.', 'The company hopes to expand to 200 drivers soon even as many of the current 50 members are on their way to becoming empowered part-owners of the company. ACCESS Development has already established a public limited company, with support from HSBC?and most of the women have invested in some share.']"

Today, a much bigger investment in what?s almost a two-horse race makes more sense.', 'With Amazon?s rise in the US putting the brakes on Walmart?s revenue growth, which has averaged 3.4% annually over the past decade from 12.8% the prior 10 years, the bricks-and-mortar retailer needs to find fresh ways to fend off The Everything Store. Amazon has little footing in China, which leaves India and its huge middle class.

Is it beyond time as we know it, is it sempiternal?not only everlasting but unchanging? Are we made better by knowing that love is fragile, a thing to be nurtured, protected, fed and watered? Or is it the idea of love as eternal, redemptive and salvific, that sustains us and allows us to live through unspeakable horrors, both individual and as a people?', 'The idea of love as the ultimate state of being is attractive?so much literature is about people, apparently just like us, who die for love. More accurately, we have a thousand stories about people who die before their love ends. Or changes. If we think of Romeo and Juliet, and Laila and Majnu, as being archetypal love stories, we need look no further than the subcontinent to find similar tales of tragic young love?Sohni and Mahiwal, Heer and Ranjha, from the folk tales of Punjab, and even Kannagi and Kovalan from the Tamil epicSilapathikaram. If film director Sanjay Leela Bhansali had had his untrammelled way, Padmavati andRatan Singh/Alauddin Khilji would have been included in this list as well.', 'For reasons of provenance (language and period of composition, mainly), the stories mentioned, and others like them, are considered legends or folk literature. Our classics, the epics in particular, have a rather different view of love. Stories of ecstatic, romantic, all-consuming love don?t appear in our myths. There are many stories of unrequited love or difficult love, but very few people die for it or of it. In fact, we have the opposite story to enjoy, one of living for love, as Savitri does when she wrests her beloved Satyavan from Death himself. Kunti lives to protect Pandu?s legacy even as Madri (whom he loved better) dies with him on his funeral pyre. Draupadi lives with the fact that the husband she loves most, Arjun, does not reciprocate the intensity of her feelings for him. Nal and Damayanti are separated by fate but eventually come together to live happily ever after. Shakuntala and Dushyant triumph in love after they overcome the vagaries of a decidedly peculiar curse, Parvati wins Shiv after years of difficult penance. And so on.', 'But the most complex and poignant story of a love that does not survive the choices and circumstances of its protagonists is the story of Ram and Sita. I use theValmiki Ramayanaas the basis for this understanding of the story, an understanding that considers the possibility that even the most idealized love can end. In theUttara Kanda, the last of the seven books that make up what we call theValmiki Ramayana, Sita calls upon the earth to swallow her when she is asked to prove her chastity again, this time in front of the people of Ayodhya. She asks that if she has been chaste, she be taken away. How did she get to this point, the point where the validation of her innocence against all the gossip and innuendo will lead to her exit from, rather than her continuing participation in, Ram?s life. In order to understand this, we need to reconsider the story as we know it.', 'Ram and Sita left for the forest as young people. We can surmise from other things in the story that they were probably in their early 20s, still flushed with youth. It was there that they really got to know each other, away from the hustle and bustle of duties and commitments in the opulent court of Ayodhya. They spent their happiest time with the sages and their wives, where Ram experienced a life of quietude and reflection. Already, in the days and nights since his father?s decree, Ram has questioned kshatriya dharma and doubted the values he has been taught to uphold. The sages have made him even more aware that there is another way to live in the world. After they leave the sages and settle deeper in the forest, in Chitrakut, Ram is the sweet and tender husband who brings flowers for Sita?s hair, who shares her joy and wonder at the forest animals that she feeds and looks after, who accompanies her when she goes down to the river to bathe. Sita discusses with Ram her concerns about the weapons he carries. She tells him that in the forest, violence must be renounced, and reminds him that he can go back to the manners and morals of the warrior that he was born to be when they return to Ayodhya. Ram listens and assures her he will use his weapons only against the oppressed. But, as Sita had predicted, it is violence that shatters their idyllic life. Shurpanakha is brutally mutilated, an act which results in a terrifying and vengeful retaliation against Sita. A cycle of blood-lust has been unleashed that will only be quenched with the killing of Ravan.', 'Once his wife has been stolen, Ram realizes that he has to become a kshatriya again if he is to win her back. Sita sustains herself during their separation with memories of her beloved from their time in the forest. When she meets Hanuman, apart from giving him her hair ornament as a token of recognition, she sends him back with a message for Ram. The message is a story of sweet intimacy, when she and Ram were alone together, a story that no one but the two of them could have known. These are the memories of love that make it possible for Sita to hold her head high when Ravan cajoles and threatens her. She can be strong because she knows she has not been abandoned.', '', 'Ram, on the other hand, appears to increasingly put away memories of Sita after his heart-rending sorrow when he finds her missing. He berates Lakshman for leaving her alone, he begs the trees and the animals to tell him where she has gone. But after this, he hardens his heart?it?s as if he knows that because she has been taken by another man, he will have to reject her when he gets her back. He will vanquish Ravan because that is what Kshatriya dharma demands, but that does not mean that he will be reunited with his wife, whom he loves more than anything else, in a happily-ever-after scenario.', 'After Sita has been taken, Ram expresses his anguish more and more in terms of the loss of his kingdom and the fact that he might lose his brave and loyal brother Lakshman. Sita is absent from his conversations, perhaps even from his mind. He kills Ravan to avenge his honour as the prince of Ayodhya, acting as a kshatriya should. While Sita has thought of nothing but her love, Ram has been busy putting together an alliance and planning a war.', 'The man that Sita meets after the war with therakshasas(demons) is not the man she knew and loved in the forest. She sees a battle-hardened warrior, a man who prefers to meet her in public rather than a husband who would wipe her tears of joy in private after such a long separation. This man tells her that he cannot take her back because she has lived in the house of another man. He has no use for her any more, she can go where she pleases. The war was fought not for her but for the honour of his family. Sita is horrified and asks Lakshman to build a fire?she will take a public trial to prove that she has been chaste. Of course, she is vindicated and, on the surface, there is a triumphal return to Ayodhya, with the happy ending of a restored kingdom and a restored marriage merely a breath away.', 'But that breath is never exhaled. When she is pregnant, Sita becomes the subject of town gossip about her time away from Ram. Ram, now king, chooses to bow to the dictates of his public position?he asks Lakshman to take Sita away, back to the forest where they had spent their happiest times together. At this point, Sita realizes that she will never be Ram?s beloved again, she will always be his wife, his queen, his consort.', 'Fourteen years later, when Ram hears the story of his own life from his sons, he summons Sita?she must prove her innocence once more, in front of his people, so that he can be with her again. This is when Sita decides that her innocence should be the reason for her departure. Ram has become a man she does not know, cannot love; her love for him has ended. Ram has become king and Sita has lost the tender lover of the days in the forest, the man she pined for in her captivity, the man she waited to embrace after their months of separation. She decides that she cannot, will not, live with a lesser love, a love that was compromised when it was sacrificed on the altar of public duty.', 'Sita?s love could not survive all that happened to her?her abduction, her captivity, the suspicions about her and her banishment. When she finally asserts herself, it is to take control of her destiny and leave Ram forever. Ram is distraught?his love has remained steadfast through all that he made his wife endure. After Sita has left, Ram creates a golden statue of his beloved wife. The statue is not only a substitute for the queen at all the royal rituals and ceremonies, it is a reminder to Ram himself of everything that he has lost as a king. For me, this is where the tragedy of the Ramayan lies?in the understanding that love can die, despite our best intentions, despite our efforts to keep it alive. For all that Ram is devastated when Sita leaves him, it?s hard to imagine that Sita did this with any sense of joy or liberation. Her heart, too, must have been heavy. For surely, the burden of a love that has ended is far greater than that of a love that has been lost. Perhaps it is only in our maturity that we see this as a possibility. And we smile through our tears for the young who are eternally in love.', 'Arshia Sattar has been working with theValmiki Ramayanafor 30 years. Her most recent book isUttara: The Book Of Answers.']"

While climbing workshops for men from rural areas are organized every year, little or no effort is made to develop the region or nurture its climbers in the long term.', '', 'In 2015, Praveen formed a climbing team, SportClimbing India, with five teenagers from Badami?s rural areas. He donated his personal equipment to the team, and tries to upgrade it with his own money. He doesn?t charge the students. ?Most of my gear was won in competitions. When I was younger, I couldn?t afford to buy them either. I would work hard to win competitions, so I could also win the gear. Now it?s come full cycle. Whatever this sport gave me, I?m giving back to the sport,? says Praveen.', 'Last year, a climber from Chile sponsored some equipment, and Prana, a US-based clothing company, donated some clothes.

Rarer still are people or organizations that support and fund climbers. When I met Praveen three years ago, he seemed somewhat jaded by competitions. But he was excited at the idea of setting up India?s first rural climbing team. He believes Badami has the potential to turn into a world-class climbing destination.', 'Chitradurga was his next area of focus. Although this historical town has a lot of granite boulders, there were no bolted sport routes his students or otherclimbers could use. So, over two years, 2015 and 2016, Praveen set about changing that. He has also built a bouldering wall at his house in Bengaluru for students to train before competitions.', '', 'Many of them are like 15-year-old Manju Waddar, who comes from a family of nine children and lives in a house about the size of a few telephone booths squeezed together. Manju trained for about a year and a half, till his parents, both of whom work at a local market, needed help.

Is love as we knew it in peril?","['Why does good sex fade even for couples who continue to love each other as much as ever?', 'Without a preamble, this is how Esther Perel?s widely shared 2013 TED talk?almost 11.5 million views on TED.com?titled ?The Secret To Desire In A Long-Term Relationship? begins.Why is the forbidden erotic? When you love, how does it feel? When you desire, why is it different? What are you most drawn to in your partner and why?The Belgian psychotherapist and best-selling author interlinks the questions into a sticky web that seems so real that I imagine her live audience must want to scream its way out of it with a loud chorus: ?Tell us!?', 'Perel?s primary argument is that the spread of a new brand of romanticism is spelling a crisis of desire. In her 2017 bookThe State Of Affairs: Rethinking Infidelity, she unpacks these ideas further, questioning the new romantic ideal in which we turn to one person to fulfil an endless list of needs?effectively diluting the share of sex and desire in the mix. ?Marriage used to be for economic and social status?we still want that, plus we expect our partners to be our greatest lover, best friend, trusted confidant, best co-parent, emotional companion, intellectual equal?and we live twice as long,? she says. ?We want from one person what once an entire village used to provide.?', 'When Siddharth Mangharam, co-founder of the singles community Floh, told me about their new launch, Floh For All, it immediately resonated with Perel?s hypothesis. I asked if he had listened to Perel?s TED talk, and Mangharam said it was her debunking of this ?Superhero Partner? that Floh For All seeks to address. Just out of its testing phase, it is a platform comprising different communities of people looking to meet others in the same life-stage: new-to-the-city professionals, empty nesters, expectant mothers, patients (and their caregivers) with rare diseases like haemophilia and so on.', 'Loungewas one of the first publications to report on Floh, in February 2012, less than a year after it had launched. In the cover story, Mangharam, a management graduate whose first start-up, Peek, was into cloud computing, had said Floh was positioning itself as a clutter-breaker in a market crowded with wedding-oriented websites. Cool, urban India wanted to find love, and while marriage could be a long-term goal, they did not want it to colour all their relationships.', 'The business strategy came from Mangharam?s own real-life meet-cute: He had met his wife Simran (co-founder of Floh) at a party in Bengaluru over a platter of Roquefort. The idea was to go one step ahead of dating apps and websites and facilitate meetings for singles over strategically-curated group events. His lofty mission then was the ?business of catalysing serendipity?.', '', 'Seven years later, ?love? only has a supporting role to play in his business plan. What prompted the evolution of a singles dating platform into a community network? The answer, as the 2018 FlohSingle In The Citysurvey results corroborate, is that people prize everyday companionship slightly higher than romance, with emotional support a close third, when asked about the top 3 things they want from a relationship. The bottom-line is that it?s not all moons and bedrooms.', '?Our biggest insight after running Floh all these years is that people, regardless of their relationship status, are desperately seeking human companionship,? says Mangharam. There were two inflection points. Around three years ago, Floh did away with the idea of playing matchmaker. It started focusing on ?people having a good time and being themselves?. A few months ago, the idea of building a community that privileges companionship based on personal needs came up. ?Specifically, to include those looking to connect with like-minded people in the real world, but not in a romantic context,? he says. Mangharam shares instances of couples who met at Floh (or elsewhere), but have been regularly attending Floh For All events. Activities range from sushi-rolling workshops to single-malt tastings and, free from the trappings of heteronormative couplings, are open to people who identify as queer, polyamorous or asexual?as opposed to restrictive dating apps . So, while earlier it appeared distasteful if a dating network aimed at the upwardly mobile put marriage upfront, it is now undesirable for them to have even love and sex upfront. ?Floh now defines itself as a singles network and not a singles dating platform, while Floh For All is ?family and fun oriented?. It?s about putting yourself first,? says Mangharam.', '', 'Love thyself', 'Is the crisis of love today that we love ourselves a bit too much? Are we sacrificing romance at the altar of self-love? As many as 66.6% of the respondents said they were dating less now than they were a few years ago, with little variation between male and female respondents.', '?I find this response very interesting?despite the surge in dating apps, both men and women are dating a lot less than they were earlier. We are seeing this as a trend in the West too and the reasons are broadly linked to screen addiction and social media. Ultimately, a sharpening of this pattern leads to social isolation and depression. In the US, where there?s a lot of data on this topic, the number of youth dying of suicide has increased significantly.... This could be an even bigger issue in India, where our awareness  around mental health is woefully inadequate,? says Mangharam, adding, ?In a lot of ways, we intuitively felt this and thus launched Floh For All to help a broader set of people. It?s great to see strong data to back our hypothesis, though, personally, I?m concerned, and believe that we?re heading towards a loneliness epidemic.?', 'Additionally, there is a mismatch between ground realities and expectations of what is ?normal??an overwhelming majority of respondents, 62.6%, believe sex ?multiple times a week? is the prerequisite for a fulfilling relationship. But few count themselves in that number.', 'Too ready to mingle', 'For those in relationships, the crisis of love takes a different beat. One of the things that Perel explores inThe State Of Affairs: Rethinking Infidelity, and a second TED talk by the same name, is how infidelity, which earlier threatened our physical security, now threatens our emotional security. It comes back to the idea of the ?Superhero Partner?. One?s self-worth is so tied to a single partner that a partner?s infidelity threatens our very self-identity.', '?It?s never been easier to cheat and it?s never been more difficult to keep a secret and never has infidelity exacted such a psychological toll on us. Infidelity hurts differently today. It is the ultimate betrayal. It shatters the grand ambition of love,? says Perel in her talk.', 'It doesn?t help that the definition of infidelity and cheating is mutating so rapidly?sexting, pornography, staying active on dating apps well into a relationship ?that Perel estimates the figures for infidelity in committed or married couples around the world vary from 26-75%.', 'This  blurring of boundaries might explain why survey respondents said they found it harder to reconcile if their partner engaged in an emotional affair rather than a physical affair.', 'As Perel says, we would, earlier, divorce to be happy. Today we divorce because we could be happier. Choosing to stay when you can leave is the new shame as we live in an era where we believe I, not we, deserve to be happy.', 'One must pay attention when even people who used to be in the ?business of love? have shifted focus. ?At Floh, we emphasize on an individual?s need to be known, self-expression, and a positive self-identity,? says Mangharam. And if all of this can come without love as we knew it, then it has its takers.']"

True to form, Riyas Komu, whose practice has been embedded in the vocabulary of state signs and symbols, uses a range of media in his recent solo exhibition to visually discuss what he terms the presently rising ?militant enthusiasm?. Edited excerpts from an interview with the artist:', 'How did you arrive at the show?s title, ?Holy Shiver??', 'My works for the exhibition are not based on the concepts of Austrian zoologist and ethologist Konrad Lorenz?sOn Aggression, but the title came as a natural progression of my critical engagement with the themes explored. I didn?t start my work thinking ofHoly Shiverbut I came across this accidentally during the final stages of conceptualizing the exhibition and the term and concept seemed appropriate, referencing ?the behavioural tendency of willing to kill or be killed in defence of one?s own community?. Lorenz talks about how this tendency physically manifests in the tingling sensation in the spine?a pre-human reflex for the raising of hair on the back of an animal as a preparatory step for a fight when confronted with an enemy.', 'What was your artistic methodology?', 'The works that formHoly Shiverare an extension of my practice. I have been working with the image (and ideas) of (Mahatma) Gandhi and (B.R.) Ambedkar for some time now. However, I am interested in exploring these not only as figments of history or as a reminder of an ?ideal that we had?, but in their moral and conceptual frameworks, in their aesthetics and philosophies. The Gandhi/Ambedkar juxtaposition also considers the current debates, negotiations and reconciliation arguments that are prevalent in the Indian socio-political space. For me, it?s interesting to witness how our ideas of ?identity?, ?freedom? and ?sovereignty? are shifting to accommodate the onslaught of globalization and nationalism. So these works?oil portraits, woodcuts, installations and archival prints, framed in a space, time and context?are self-explanatory. I see them as an archive of our times, however incomplete it may be.', 'You transfer the image and make a woodcut out of it. On the other hand, the content of these images is deeply disturbing footage, evidence of our inhumanity. One image that I can easily identify is the woodcut version of a photograph from Pablo Bartholomew?s Hindu-Sikh riot documentation. Are you looking to recontextualize images from an existing archive?', 'TitledHoly Shiver(2018), the woodcut series are limited-edition prints that explore some of the acts of violence in social spaces throughout the history of independent India. It explores the misuse of power by the people; to self-organize, to take the law into their own hands, to disregard constitutionally granted freedoms, and to use caste-based oppression to bolster state-sanctioned authority.', '', 'It is a continuation of theStoned Goddesses(2013) series that also explored violence and the displacement of different times. I have been influenced by the stark, simplistic style of the German artist Käthe Kollwitz, who was fearless in critiquing the social systems of her time. She wanted her art to make an impact and be reflective of the times she lived and worked in. My woodcut series is representative of the images of public violence already in wide circulation. They create a tragic resonance between these dark chapters in Indian history. I have admired Pablo?s work and have collected some of his photographs of the 1984 riots. The image that I have used is from his archive, which I have also referred to in myStoned Goddessesseries. Pablo was very happy to share his image to be used for this series. I don?t mean to recontextualize these tragedies and give them new meaning or to add to what already has been said, but I mostly recontextualize images in my works as a form of remembrance. And this extends beyond my woodcut series.', 'Would you consider your show a provocation to remind audiences about their role as citizens?', 'The founding principles declared in the Constitution of India assert its citizens? right to justice, equality and liberty and establish the country as a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic. But as Ambedkar said, ?The Constitution can provide only the organs of state such as the legislature, the executive and the judiciary. The factors on which the working of those organs of the state depend are the people and the political parties they will set up as their instruments to carry out their wishes and their politics.? Our willingness to turn a blind eye to the state and social apparatuses that aim to subvert these freedoms (for a certain section of the populace) have now resulted in disillusionment with the way the system works. Of course, I understand that there is a fundamental disagreement on the idea of India, but this conflict of vision is precisely because the Constitution has afforded us certain freedoms, and not in spite of it.', 'What is your fascination with public memory?', 'I have always been fascinated with what we remember. Public memory is notoriously short-lived. And I think it?s a challenge to situate public memory at a time when we are oversaturated with images and when certain sections of the society are happy with the hyper-partisan news, information and images that simply conform to what they already know and believe in. So in a way, the public?s memory is the curse of the public. This is perhaps why it?s easier to erase certain symbols from history than to reinstate their intent. So yes, in a way there is the need to question public?s memory or the ways in which we (the people) remember certain histories. That?s why many works inHoly Shiveremploy (or challenges the viewer to rely on) public memory to unravel momentous melancholies in time. Our current political rhetoric betrays an intense pursuit of politico-ideological legitimacy in the liberalized world. So, I believe this act of questioning has always been present in my works, be itMyFather?s Balcony,Designated March By A Petrol Angelor the current show.', 'Holy Shiveris on view till 3 March at Vadehra Art Gallery, New Delhi.

Photographer Pablo Bartholomew, along with the academy?s students of visual and fine arts, has been designing an exhibition inspired by the DNA sequences of Chakma weavers.', 'Long horizontal lines, drawn out withjhaadu ki teeli(reeds used in brooms), are interspersed with 24 photographs taken by Bartholomew of this indigenous hill tribe in Bangladesh and North-East India. Through this new body of work,Untitled, created especially for the nine-day Dhaka Art Summit (DAS, 2-10 February), he takes a closer look at this community, spread across geographies. He also investigates how its cultural DNA?embodied in weaves, oral traditions, body markings and adornments?becomes a mark of self-identity, thus creating an indelible bond that keeps the community together in the midst of constant displacement and migration.', '', 'The work fits in with the overarching theme of DAS? fourth edition, Bearing Points, which replaces the Solo Projects section of the summit with large-scale thematic presentations by artists and architects. One of the Bearing Points, There Was Once A Village Here, is a cross-border inquiry into cultures inhabiting ?sensitive spaces?, ones that challenge ideas of nations, states and territories. Bartholomew talks about the direction that this ?work-in-progress? is likely to take in the future. Edited excerpts from a phone interview:', 'A lot of your recent work, ?Nagas: Hidden Hill People Of India? and ?Affinities?, draws on personal associations and memories. How does the current work take this thread forward?', 'I have a family link of sorts with the Chakma community, from my mother?s side. The project, which has been commissioned and backed by the Samdani Art Foundation (the organizer of DAS), is about fractured geographies and the communities that inhabit these. They live across borders in Bangladesh, Burma (Myanmar) and India. So far, I have been able to interact with the Chakma community in Bangladesh and India, and hope to visit Burma in the future. In some ways, the genesis of this work goes back to the visual anthropological project with the Naga tribes. That too had a personal story to it. While growing up, I had heard stories from my father of the kindness that the tribes had shown him, as he walked from Burma to India to escape persecution from the invading Japanese forces. Over a period of 10 years, starting 1989, I photographed the tribes, documenting the Naga fusion of tradition and modernity. While Nagas were the main group I photographed, I also took photos of ethnic groups in Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur as well. That?s when I came across cultural markers, across indigenous communities, as forms of self-identity. It is triggers such as these that shape and inspire my practice.', '', 'You have extended the scope of your practice by incorporating weaves?', 'The current body of work is just an experiment. The weaving is sort of a test to see if the Chakma artisans can depart from their traditional weaves to interpret DNA markers. Eventually, what will happen is that diagrams of the DNA, mapped by scientific research institutions, will be sent back to the tribes, to be woven. It will be a metaphoric way of saying how the tradition of craft is carried forth generationally through the DNA. Through these woven patterns, they will then look at their own shared genetic make-up that goes beyond modern-day boundaries and geopolitical borders.', 'How have the weavers responded to your idea?', 'I am working with a national award-winning master weaver and some village women, who have taken up the challenge. That?s the interesting part?how different weavers are approaching the concept to produce very different results.', 'You are bringing together science, legend, tradition and art. Could you talk about your collaborations with the scientists?', 'I have been in dialogue with several research institutes such as The Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad, and the Genome Foundation, Hyderabad. I will try and work with Dr Niraj Rai, who is an ancient DNA specialist. The mentor for the scientific aspect of the project was Dr Lalji Singh (also known as the father of Indian DNA fingerprinting), who passed away recently. It is because of such instances that the project has taken several twists and turns. Right now, what you see before you is proof of concept. I hope to realize it fully by the next Dhaka Art Summit in 2020.', 'We have seen fabulous images of the work being put together on Instagram. Could you talk about this unique exhibition design?', 'When I arrived in Dhaka, some weeks ago, I didn?t know what I would use as my base medium. After discussions with a fantastic team of volunteers of art and photography students, we zeroed in on thejhaadu ki teeli, that is used with water to sweep, as the base. One thing that I was very clear about was that I wanted to base the exhibition design on the DNA patterns. The lines and columns on the wall are suggestive of the wells of the gel, into which the broken-up DNA is injected, which then settles at different points. The framed photos have been placed at those points. The photos showcase the everyday objects and landscapes of the Chakma people. The work has been divided into three parts?with images of the Chakmas from Tripura on the left, those from the Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bangladesh, on the right. At the very centre are images of four textiles by weavers from either side of the border, who have interpreted the DNA in their patterns.']"

Yuri Afanasiev, resident coordinator of the UN in India, toldLoungein a phone interview that ?we are no authority on fashion but we have a strong grass-roots base in the North-East region?.', 'The collaboration, ?still at an embryonic stage?, aims to study the sector and provide a strategy to develop the region?s fashion supply chain. Afanasiev points out the changing ways that support needs to be provided in growing economies. ?Providing craftspeople stalls in the local market is not the answer any more. The answer today is really about integrating into modern supply chains. How do we fill the gap between beautiful craftsmanship, colours and patterns, and what the market demands? What do local producers need to be able to bridge that gap? How can designers and corporations help with issues like quality and quantity? Complying with export rules and regulations?that kind of advice is not available to the average Indian farmer, weaver or textile business owner. That?s where this partnership makes sense,? he says. The UN is particularly focused on women?s developement, ?because the labour participation of women in India is remarkably low at 27%, and actually has a declining trend which is not characteristic of big, vibrant economies that are growing at 7-8% a year.?', 'At the same time, there are concerns about over-commercialization.  ?It?s an area of very fragile eco-systems. There are traditional crafts that can be sustainably developed instead of introducing some modern industry,? says Afanasiev.', 'From a designer?s perspective, Dev Varman stresses the need to have ?a light footprint? when working in the North-East. ?There?s a responsibility in being a catalyst. You can go in and not be aware of the long-term consequences of your actions, because it can be very heady to create something new. Craft traditions are a way of life for certain people. These are fine minds, not just skilled labour. So, as designers, we must be sensitive to that,? says Dev Varman.', 'When footballer Bhaichung Bhutia walked the ramp for Karma Sonam?a designer from Sikkim who presented her label, Kuzu?the cheers wouldn?t stop. At a post-show press conference, a shy, smiling Bhutia said: ?People from the North-Eastern states have always been very stylish.? The show was enough evidence of that.']"

Three militants detonated suicide vests and two others were killed in the clash, the Guards said.', 'Days earlier, Iran?s intelligence ministry found a weapons cache in the town of Marivan on the Iranian side of the border that included TNT, C4, electronic detonators, grenades, ammunition clips for AK-47 machine guns and rocket propelled grenades.', 'The clash and discovery indicate that Islamic State still has the ability to penetrate the tightly controlled security net of the Islamic Republic, which has largely managed to avoid the devastation wrought by the group in neighboring countries.', '?Today (Islamic State) does not control a country ... in order to assert that they exist, they may carry out an attack any day,? Hossein Dehghan, a former defense minister and now an adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said in a recent interview with the semi-official Tasnim news agency.', 'Halabja, the largest town on the Iraqi side, is most often remembered for a chemical attack ordered by then-President Saddam Hussein in 1988 which left thousands dead.', 'The presence of religious militants in the area around the town is not new: at the city?s entrance hang portraits of Iraqi Kurdish security forces, known as Peshmerga, killed in the battle against Islamic State.', 'Prior to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the jihadist largely blamed for stoking a civil war between Iraq?s Sunnis and Shi?ites, led a group in the area called Ansar al-Islam, which merged with Islamic State in 2014.', 'Many of the Iranian and Iraqi Kurds now fighting with Islamic State are part of a second generation of militants largely influenced by Zarqawi?s deadly legacy, Iraqi security officials and Peshmerga commanders familiar with the matter say.', 'Sunni IS militants see Shi?ites, who make up the majority of Iran?s population, as apostates and have repeatedly threatened to carry out attacks in the Islamic Republic. Kurds make up about ten percent of Iranians and are predominantly Sunni.', 'Hamai Hama Seid, a senior Peshmerga commander and member of the Iraqi Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) party, said Kurdish IS militants take advantage of their knowledge of the language and region as well as strong cross-border ties.', '?There are definitely ties between the Iranian and Iraqi extremists on the two sides of the border,? Seid told Reuters in the Iraqi border village of Tawila, only a few hundred meters from the Iranian border. He added:', '?The militants exploited this area because it?s mountainous, difficult and wooded.?', 'Many of the young men are poorly educated and have few economic opportunities, allowing extremist recruiters to flourish, Iraqi security officials and Peshmerga commanders say.', 'Iranian authorities say the arms cache found on the border was going to be used to attack civilians in public areas, a follow-up to the shocking assault on the parliament in Tehran and the mausoleum of the founder of Iran?s revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, last June that left at least 18 people dead and dozens wounded.', 'Islamic State claimed responsibility for that assault and threatened more. The Revolutionary Guards responded by raining missiles on the militants in Syria and arresting dozens of suspects in Iran.', 'The June attack was conceived by an Iraqi militant using the nom de guerre Abu Aisha, a senior commander in a unit of Islamic State fighting in Iraq and Syria made up exclusively of Kurds, according to the Iranian ministry of intelligence.', 'The Tehran attackers fought in Mosul and Raqqa and trained outside Iran, the ministry said.', 'Photos posted online show Abu Aisha, a member of Ansar al-Islam prior to joining Islamic State, beheading Peshmerga soldiers while wearing a traditional Kurdish outfit.', 'In the fall of 2016, a number of Kurdish Islamic State militants led by Abu Aisha came to an Iraqi border village near Halabja to try to establish a base of operations which could carry out attacks in both Iran and Iraq, according to Iraqi security officials familiar with the matter.', 'Peshmerga killed Abu Aisha in December 2016, according to Iraqi security officials and Kurdish activist Mokhtar Hooshmand, who was jailed in Iran on national security charges from 2010 to 2012 and met dozens of Sunni extremists behind bars.', 'Afterward, Serias Sadeghi, who ran a bakery with his brother in Paveh, an Iranian town about 15 km (9 miles) from the border, took over as lead planner for the Tehran attacks, Hooshmand said by telephone from outside Iran.', 'Sadeghi knew Abu Aisha and had crossed back and forth into Iraq with him multiple times.', '?Sadeghi was still very eager that this operation be carried out,? Hooshmand said. ?He played a key role.?', 'During the attack on Khomeini?s mausoleum, Sadeghi detonated a suicide vest, shooting up an orange fireball captured on amateur video. The other four attackers were also killed.', 'Critics of the Iranian government say the Islamic Republic is reaping what they sowed in the area: it failed to crack down earlier on the militants because they served as a counter-balance to secular groups who opposed the central government.', 'The Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI), an Iranian opposition group fighting for greater autonomy for the Kurdish community, posted a report online in 2014 about militants spreading propaganda for Islamic State and trying to recruit young men for the group in Iran. They named Sadeghi as an individual actively recruiting in Paveh.', '?They were in most of the mosques in Kurdistan and spread propaganda but none of them were arrested by the Islamic Republic,? said Mohammad Saleh Ghaderi, a representative of the PDKI in Erbil.', 'Attempts to reach representatives from the Iranian Ministry of Interior were not successful. But documents show Iranian authorities were aware of the growing threat.', 'A report issued by Iran?s Ministry of Interior noted in 2014: ?Many Salafist Iranian Kurds have announced the readiness to join Islamic State in Iraq and many have traveled to Syria.', '?Salafi and Takfiri Iranian groups are pumping Iranian Kurdish youth toward Islamic State and sending them to Iraq,? the report said, using terms employed by Iranian officials to describe Sunni religious extremists.', '?Not a day goes by that funerals are not held for them in Iranian Kurdistan and Iraqi Kurdistan,? the report said.

Alongside modern spider traits such as a silk-producing structure called a spinneret, it possessed a remarkably primitive feature: a whip-like tail covered in short hairs that it may have used for sensing predators and prey.', '?It is a key fossil for understanding spider origins,? said paleontologist Bo Wang of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. ?Our new fossil most likely represents the earliest branch of spiders, and implies that there was a lineage of tailed spiders that presumably originated in the Paleozoic (the geological era that ended 251 million years ago) and survived at least into the Cretaceous of Southeast Asia.?', 'Despite its fearsome appearance, the fanged Chimerarachne was only about three-tenths of an inch (7.5 mm) long, more than half of which was its tail.', 'University of Kansas paleontologist Paul Selden said Chimerarachne represents ?a kind of missing link? between true spiders and earlier spider forerunners that had tails but lacked spinnerets.', '?Chimerarachne\xa0could be considered as a spider.

Waymo said that one of the company?s former engineers, Anthony Levandowski, downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files containing designs for autonomous vehicles before he went on to work at Uber, leading the ride-hailing firm?s self-driving car unit.', 'During opening statements in San Francisco federal court on Monday, Waymo attorney Charles Verhoeven attempted to focus the 10-person jury on Kalanick and his famously pugnacious style.', 'One internal Uber document from April 2016 that Waymo presented in court shows a list of Kalanick?s priorities that had been recorded by another executive. Kalanick wanted to use ?cheat codes? against competitors, and he declared ?the golden time is over. It is war time? and that ?going slower is NOT an option anymore,? according to the document.', 'The competitive pressures were so great to develop self-driving cars that Kalanick decided ?winning was more important than obeying the law,? Verhoeven told the jury.', 'Uber attorney Bill Carmody said Uber had not cheated and called Waymo?s case a ?conspiracy? theory that ?just doesn?t make sense when you get the whole story.?', 'Waymo listed Kalanick fourth on a witness list filed late on Monday, making it likely he will take the witness stand this week. How Kalanick, who was forced out of the job of chief executive in June, portrays himself and tells the story of the company he co-founded will be a critical moment.', 'Verhoeven questioned Kalanick at a pretrial deposition last year. An experienced intellectual property litigator, Verhoeven counts Google as a longtime client and also represented Samsung against Apple Inc (AAPL.O) in a 2012 trial over smartphone patents. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) suffered a jury verdict of about $1 billion, but that amount was reduced on appeal.', 'For Verhoeven, the key will be to get under Kalanick?s skin and cause him to become angry and combative, said John Hueston, a former federal prosecutor who cross-examined Enron founder Ken Lay.', 'Waymo calling Kalanick as one of its own witnesses is a classic strategy, Hueston said, because it allows Waymo to question him first and try to make him uncomfortable from the moment he begins testifying.', 'Since Kalanick?s lawyers likely will have long prepared him to respond to broader accusations from Waymo, Verhoeven could try to aggravate Kalanick by closely probing at smaller details, Hueston said. If Kalanick appears unlikeable and even aggressive, it will reinforce Waymo?s argument that winning was more important than honesty at Uber.', 'For Kalanick, avoiding the temptation to fight Waymo on every minor point will be crucial, Hueston said. By admitting small mistakes, he said, Kalanick will likely elicit more sympathy.', '?Jurors will often develop a sense of good guy, bad guy based on how the face of the company does on the stand,? said Hueston, who is not involved in the case.', 'Waymo and Uber declined to comment, and Kalanick?s lawyers could not immediately be reached.', 'Kalanick?s testimony is especially important because of how closely he managed Uber during his more than eight years there and molded it in his image before he was forced out by investors who feared his leadership style would hurt the company. It was Kalanick who created Uber?s values of ?toe-stepping? and ?always be hustlin,? and through his large stock ownership and voting control determined many of Uber?s business decisions.', 'Kalanick spearheaded Uber?s acquisition of Levandowski?s startup, a self-driving truck company called Otto, and he famously called Levandowski ?a brother from another mother.?

For example, someone who builds their own home with no permits on land they own is more likely to be treated as a homeowner, said Justo Hernandez, FEMA?s deputy federal coordinating officer.

Quirindongo said.', 'Many others appear to have given up on FEMA aid because the agency?s application process is entangled with a separate process for awarding SBA loans to rebuild homes.', 'FEMA is legally bound to assess whether applicants might qualify for SBA loans before awarding them FEMA grants. If an applicant passes FEMA?s cursory eligibility assessment, they are automatically referred to SBA for a more thorough screening.', 'Applicants are not required to follow through on the SBA process - but they cannot qualify for FEMA aid unless they do. FEMA only provides a grant when the SBA denies the applicant a loan.', 'FEMA said it has referred about 520,000 people out of 1.1 million total applicants so far to the SBA. But as of Monday, only 59,000 followed through with SBA applications. Of those, some 12,000 later withdrew, SBA data shows.', '?As soon as people see SBA they say, ?I give up, I don?t want a loan - I can?t afford a loan,??

He drove Uber?s 2016 acquisition of Otto, the self-driving truck startup founded by Levandowski, which merged the companies? businesses and put Levandowski in charge of Uber?s autonomous-driving unit.', 'At one point, Kalanick was shown notes from another Uber executive that captured Kalanick?s sentiments about the Otto deal.

His exit followed months of scandal, including a public allegation of sexual harassment that triggered an internal investigation and resulted in more than 20 employees being fired, litigation and federal criminal probes that led shareholders to question his leadership abilities.
