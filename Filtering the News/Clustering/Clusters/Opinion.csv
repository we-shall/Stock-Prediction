You have to hold equity for 1 year, real estate for 2 years and debt for 3 years for the profit made to become ?long term?. This classification of assets is against Finance 101","['Every time people who have defined benefit retirement plans make rules for the market, their lack of understanding comes across clearly. Take people in the Ministry of Finance for instance, and then look at what subsequent Budgets have put in place. Not only is there arbitrage between asset classes on the definition of long term, there is arbitrage within an asset class too on the basis of which product you choose to buy. If tax policy is used to nudge behaviour, there is some serious malfunction in the Indian policy that is nudging in all the wrong directions and all the wrong products.', 'In India we answer the question, ?How many years does it take for an asset to become long-term?? in different ways depending on the asset. You have to hold equity for 1 year, real estate for 2 years and debt for 3 years for the profit made to become ?long term?. This classification of assets is against Finance 101, since both equity and real estate are asset classes that cook slowly over time. They give their best performance over a long period of time. How long is long? Data analysis done by my colleague Kayezad E. Adajania (read ithere) shows that it takes about a 7-year holding period to iron out volatility in equity. The thumb rule for real estate puts the cycle at about 10 years. Market-linked debt (as opposed to relatively fixed-return debt products such as bank deposits) as an asset class for retail investors is mostly used for short-term purposes for emergency funds, for near-term cash needs and for income generation. It would be more logical to make debt go long term at 1 year and keep a 5-year threshold for long term for both equity and real estate. At the very least, policymakers need to equalize the definition of long term across asset classes.', 'Worse, Budget 2018 is nudging investors away from mutual funds and towards equity unit-linked insurance plans (Ulips). The tax on long-term equity is applicable to direct equity and equity-oriented mutual funds, but not on equity-oriented Ulips.  In terms of disclosure, transparency and retail invest friendliness, mutual funds are better than Ulips. For example, the mutual fund expense ratio includes all the costs, but Ulip expense ratio leaves out the mortality costs making the real returns lower. It is unclear why the government would want to direct retail money away from a better product to an inferior one. Why create arbitrage in the way somebody approaches equity?', '', 'Policy changes are slow and convincingbabusthat they don?t understand markets is an uphill task. Meanwhile, what should you do? Two things. One, rethink if you want to be in managed funds and consider shifting fully to exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Remember that managed funds carry ?fund manager risk? or the risk of wrong choices made by the fund manager. Till the time the long-term tax was introduced in equity funds, it was possible to exit from a poor-performing fund to buy a better performing one without a tax implication. Now, however, each time the investor shifts after a year, there is a tax to pay. This will eat into returns in hand post the expense ratios, of an average of 2% per year and the tax. Index funds or ETFs do not carry fund manager risk, since they replicate the index they are benchmarked to. They are also much cheaper, with costs down to 5 basis points in one ETF. As a long-term investor, you will need to do the math on what works for you?riding the ETF and facing lower returns than the managed fund investors or buying into the managed fund and getting your fund choice right.', 'Two, use the window uptill 31  March 2018 to rejig your equity portfolio. Profits made on equity and equity funds have been grandfathered till 31 January 2018. This means that your long-term capital gains as on that day are not taxed. In addition, if you book long-term capital gains, if any till 31March 2018, these will not be taxed. From today till the end of March, you have a window to rework your portfolio without there being a tax liability. Mutual fund portfolios tend to get bloated over time and also tend to get overexposed to a sub-category of funds. A portfolio clean-up is a good annual exercise anyway, but this year it is even more crucial to do the clean up before mid-March. Mid-March because you need time to sell and then buy again the funds that you choose. Choose wisely this time, for the tax on mistakes is now 10.4%. But remember, this is not a call to sell your entire portfolio, but to rejig it.', 'Monika Halan writes on household finance, policy and regulation.

Or is it a tacit acknowledgment that in the battle for affordable healthcare, the world?s richest and most powerful economy has been beaten?', 'The three companies announced they would set up an independent healthcare company for their US employees numbering nearly 1 million. Each of them  has billions of dollars in earnings which they can bring to fund any such initiative. Impressive as those numbers are, their impact on US business extends beyond that with each of them considered a pace setter in their industry.', 'Amazon?s founder Jeffrey Bezos has already shown what he can do even with an under-threat product likeWashington Postand of course Warren Buffet, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, doesn?t flirt with ideas. So if these two moguls backed by Jamie Dimon, chairman of J.P.

That three such unrelated business tycoons are teaming up could well imply that the government-supported model of affordable healthcare isn?t viable, whether it be Barak Obama?s Obamacare, Donald Trump?s Better Care Reconciliation Act or in India the newly floated Modicare plan. It is possible that affordable healthcare is an oxymoron, somewhat like cheap Chanel.', 'Announcing the new venture Bezos seemed to suggest that, stating in a release on the occasion: ?Hard as it might be, reducing healthcare?s burden on the economy while improving outcomes for employees and their families would be worth the effort.?', 'It isn?t the first time the failure of the US to take care of its sick and ailing citizens has been brought up. But its impact on business itself hasn?t been discussed often enough.', 'In May 2017 during Berkshire Hathaway?s annual shareholders meeting, Buffett dubbed rising healthcare costs, not the tax system, the number one problem that US businesses face. As he explained then, that?s because medical costs, which are borne to a great extent by business, have gone up from 5% of GDP in the 1960s to 17% today.', 'In a searing indictment, he dubbed medical costs ?the tapeworm? of American economic competitiveness. Typical of him, his partner, Charlie Munger, Berkshire?s vice chairman, was more forthright, noting that sometimes there?s ?too much medicine? and ?too much chemotherapy? for people who are ?all but dead.?', 'If this is the state of affairs in the US, after years of grappling with the issue, what are the chances of a similar state-financed system in a country like India where even basic healthcare, paid or unpaid, is of abysmal quality.', 'Sadly, private health insurance, which makes up the majority of the insurance schemes in India, has failed to provide adequate and low-cost coverage to those who need it most. In any case, most insurance schemes do not cover the cost of consultation or medication and are limited to hospitalization and allied expenses.', 'Perhaps the answer lies in companies accepting that the healthcare needs of their employees are their responsibility and building it into the cost of doing business.', 'It isn?t as if the model doesn?t exist. In the past, India?s public sector giants as well as some of the large private companies built efficient healthcare systems in the industrial townships they developed. In Jamshedpur, for instance, Tata Steel runs the 900-bed multi-disciplinary Tata Main Hospital (TMH) along with six clinics for its employees and their families. It also has hospitals in Jamadoba, Noamundi, Sukinda and West Bokaro, places from where it sources its raw materials. All these facilities are also available to those who live in these areas but don?t work for the company.

Instead, praise the machines?and blame them, too.', 'Last year, Marko Kolanovic, global head of quantitative and derivative research at JPMorgan, estimated that stock pickers?those who trade on stock-specific fundamentals?account for just 10% of today?s stock market trading volumes. Some 60% of trading?twice the share of 10 years ago?is ?passive and quantitative investing.? Nearly half is high-frequency trading by algorithms; though its share is down from the 2009 peak, it?s responsible for pretty much all of the stock market?s volume gains this century.', 'The industry and its regulators have accepted this because the algorithms have been shown to improve market liquidity as they search for speculative opportunities. It?s highly likely, however, that the algorithms?though they?re supposed to do a better job of trading on publicly available information than humans do?have caused the stock market to decouple from important information streams that existed in a human-dominated market. As Thierry Foucault and Sophie Moinas of Toulouse School of Economics wrote in a paper published last month,', 'High frequency traders? ability to quickly extract signals from order flows (trades and price changes) could increase the rate at which informed investors? informational advantage (?alpha?) decays. If this is the case then high frequency trading might reduce the profitability of producing fundamental information and thereby make asset prices less informative about firms? future cash flows in the long run.', 'Indeed, Duke University?s Brian Weller has shown that algorithmic trading deters information acquisition, potentially distorting asset prices and weakening capital allocations.', 'In a sense, thanks to the algorithmic shift, the stock market has become more like the one in bitcoin, also driven largely by algorithmic trading. It?s not that the assets in such markets don?t have a fundamental value?bitcoin does, too, insofar as it allows anonymous transactions that are not transparent to the authorities. It?s just that the fundamental value matters far less than speculative opportunities, which computers, with their superior ability to analyze statistics, can detect better than humans. Relying primarily on information that can lead to short-term gains means, essentially, feeding on what the rest of the market is doing to a greater degree than a human investor does.', 'Existing research is inconclusive on whether algorithmic trading increases volatility: Some recent studies have found that it does, some that it doesn?t. If algos do induce greater price fluctuations, though, there?s a strong ripple effect these days since there?s a large market in volatility-linked instruments?a market that is far removed from stock and economic fundamentals. There are indications that unraveling bets on the volatility index contributed to the current stock market plunge.', 'Trump appears to hold an old-fashioned view of the stock market, linking its performance to investors? expectations about the economy and how companies will do. That explains the White House?s reaction to the stock market drop: Trump?s press secretary, Sara Huckabee Sanders, said the ?president?s focus is on our long-term economic fundamentals.? That?s a good focus for a policymaker to have?but he should also be aware that the stock market is not a good indicator of success or failure. It?s increasingly a thing in itself.', 'That has even bigger implications for ordinary Americans than for Trump. Some 54% of them invest in equities directly, through mutual funds or 401 (k) plans. Shares make up some 35.5% of US households? total financial assets, compared with 20.7% in France and about 11% in the UK and Germany. Americans are more exposed than people in other big, rich nations to a market that, today, is not closely linked to the fundamental value of assets that are traded in it.

Given the uptick seen in inflation, it was a prudent decision. A bigger challenge for RBI will be navigating through the next financial year. Higher yields, inflation and election cycle in the US and India are likely to lead to an increase in financial volatility in global and Indian asset markets and make RBI?s task increasingly difficult.', 'While there are challenges, India?s growth outlook is looking better than ever. The government?s move to recapitalize public sector banks (PSBs) will ensue that credit is available for productive activities, in particular to micro, small and medium enterprises.', 'The capital allocation has also been thought through as banks under RBI?s prompt corrective action have been given higher allocation so as to ensure that they will be in a position to lend and grow. Moreover, government?s planned spending on roads, affordable housing and railways along with pick-up in exports will ensure that economic growth improves to 7.5% in 2018-19 from 6.5% in 2017-18.\xa0Will this growth be inflationary? This will be the biggest factor deciding RBI?s rate trajectory. As of now, the industrial sector is sitting on excess capacity. Even as growth outlook is improving, the private sector is still not looking at expanding capacity. According to CMIE data, capital formation in the country has increased only by higher government orders which now form 55% of outstanding order book compared to 45%, a few years ago. Investment in real estate is also weak as households are increasingly investing in financial assets such as mutual funds instead of housing. As a result, even as the gap between potential and actual output narrows, there may not be a generalized pressure on inflation.', 'Inflation data for now corroborates this. The recent increase in inflation is driven by vegetables and housing. If we exclude the above two (including pulses which is deflating the index), CPI inflation has averaged 4.2% during April-December 2017 compared with 4.9% in FY17 and 4.5% in FY16. This has been achieved despite oil prices doubling in the last two years. In addition, global food prices have not yet seen a pass-through of higher energy prices.\xa0However, pressure on food inflation may increase. The government reiterated its stand on doubling farm incomes by 2022 in the Union budget. For the same, the government is looking at ensuring that farmers are remunerated adequately. Food subsidy to Food Corp. of India has been increased by Rs36,000 crore in the budget.', 'Higher oil prices will not only add to inflation but also put pressure on government?s fiscal arithmetic and consumption. The decline in the last few days if sustains will be helpful. Higher oil prices imply that households will allocate larger share of wallet to cooking and transport fuels thus substituting demand for other goods. Lower consumption also implies lower indirect tax collections. The government may look at reducing taxes on transport fuels to cushion the impact on retail prices which implies risk of fiscal slippage (as seen in FY18).', 'In addition, India?s trade deficit as well as current account deficit will also expand. Oil imports have already increased to $76 billion in the first nine months of this financial year compared with $61 billion in the same period last year.', 'Monthly oil imports are now at $10 billion a month ($7.5 billion in FY17). India?s current account deficit is likely to expand to 2.2% of GDP in 2017-18 from 0.7% in 2016-17. Even with a rising trade deficit, the rupee has been appreciating on the back of weaker US currency. A global risk-off may change the trend.', 'The balance of risks points to higher rather than lower inflation. Rising bond yields are also pointing to a pick-up in growth and inflation. The bond market is anticipating RBI to tighten monetary policy sooner than later. However, given that India continues to maintain positive real rates, RBI need not move in a hurry and has enough room to wait. Even as we see RBI holding rates on Wednesday, MPC members will sound extremely cautious and chart out the risks on the inflation front. A sharper-than-expected rise in international oil prices may change the thesis. Otherwise, we foresee a pause by RBI in 2018.', 'Sameer Narang is chief economist at Bank of Baroda.']"

And this is one industry that has witnessed constant change, subjected to the vagaries of the global economy. And even now, economies around the world are undergoing metamorphosis. The rise in emerging markets, the proliferation of innovative technologies, sustainability policies and changing consumer preferences are impacting industries globally without exception. Industries have been impacted by digitization, enhanced automation and new business models. Globally, the automobile industry is witnessing a rapid change in customer expectations. As the technology and automotive worlds merge, preferences are rapidly shifting away from traditional choices towards more advanced and feature-centric ones.', 'The automotive industry is likely to change more rapidly over the next 6-10 years than it has over the past decade. The industry has been facing a discontinuity in the nature of mobility, and the products and services needed to satisfy the emerging customer preferences. We are witnessing a rapid change in the industry with a new emerging shared economy, faster changes and disruptions in mobility, and a higher shift towards services. With a shift in customer preferences, there is an increased number of new entrants into the market bringing in disruptive trends?electrification, autonomous driving and connectivity.', 'Most industry experts agree that these trends will reinforce the automotive industry, which is ripe for disruption. In the last five years, leveraging the internet of things, leading automobile companies have latched on to the concept of connected cars by partnering with global technology giants. As a result, the cars in developed markets currently have a variety of solutions for processing platforms to support applications aimed at creating a seamless driving experience. Soon drivetrains will shift towards hybrid-electric, electric and fuel-cell technologies as they mature and become more affordable. The operation of automated cars will move from advanced driver assistance systems to fully autonomous driving as the technology matures. Innovations in ?infotainment?, novel traffic services, and new business models and services will increase as cars get connected to each other, to the wider infrastructure, and to people. New entrants/start-ups and tech giants are well-positioned to make advancements in novel areas.

Artificial intelligence is becoming a reality and electric vehicles (EVs) are here to stay. How will India?s automobile industry keep pace?', 'Over the years, global innovations in the Indian automotive industry brought in to meet customer aspirations have set a positive trend. The government of India?s Smart Cities Mission is a welcome step towards accelerating the pace of development in the right direction. Given the smart aspirations of India?s connected generation, the automobile industry will have to step up its game and play a leading role by providing smart mobility solutions that are critical for the seamless emergence of smart cities as envisaged by the Prime Minister. These smart solutions must not only create a better quality of life for Indians but also reduce their environmental footprint by dovetailing cutting-edge urban planning with smart infrastructure.', 'As automakers we can be one of the greatest contributors of mobility solutions to the Smart Cities Mission. Smart mobility not only applies to private vehicles but also public transport. Hence, end-to-end integrated mobility solutions across commercial and passenger vehicles are the need of the hour. Connected vehicles will bring the digital lives of customers into the cars they drive and give them access to a whole new world of experiences. To ensure sustainability, EVs will be an integral part of smart city transportation. Automakers can make the most of the impending EV wave in India, given that the government is planning to achieve 100% e-mobility by 2030. Expertise in EV manufacturing is an ideal way to make a difference in building smart cities. Towards this, Indian automakers will have to change the product and component mix, bringing EV components and vehicles to life, building the right talent pool and skill set, improving the performance of batteries and EVs, and building scale. This will allow the industry to drive the EV disruption in India.', 'After all, the future is about being smart, being connected and being in sync. It is about personalization and integration.

And the tax cuts could add fuel to the fire by putting more money in the hands of companies and consumers, thus stoking inflation; more reason for the Fed to increase rates faster.', 'Meanwhile, the stock markets were cheering the economic growth and the stimulus from the tax rate cut; leading to stock markets going up throughout January.', 'In anticipation of the 2 February 2018 employment report, bond yields started rising again from 1 February itself. Data showed that non-farm payroll employment increased by 200,000 and the unemployment rate was 4.1%?considered a nearly full employment scenario. Further, the report showed that wages had grown by 2.9%. This wage inflation and the tight labour market situation were clear indicators that inflation was likely to increase. Bond market yields started rising further (in other words, there was more selling in bond markets and yields rose) since the Fed would now have clear data points showing higher risks of inflation as well as better economic growth. Adding uncertainty to this was the fact that Jerome Powell would take over from Janet Yellen on 5 February 2018 as chair of the US Fed. Would he be more hawkish? The US bond markets and the economic data clearly indicated a high chance of the Fed hiking rates, starting March. Stock markets realized that the higher Fed rates and higher bond yields meant that the opportunity cost of holding stocks had increased, especially for the leveraged trader. Hence, a sell-off began in the stock markets on 2 February with a 666-point drop in Dow. That triggered a global stock market sell-off, including in the Sensex and the Nifty.', 'To summarize the Sherlockian saga, the good economic data from the US triggered a sell-off in bonds, which triggered a sell-off in US stocks due to higher opportunity costs (or higher discount rates, going forward). This triggered a sell-off in Indian stocks as well.', 'The forecast for earnings growth over the next 3 years for the US and European markets is in double digits. India, too, is expected to have an earnings growth of nearly 20% for FY19 and possibly even higher for the next 3 years. The forward price-to-earnings multiples are below 20; definitely not overvalued territory.', 'To close off with an ironical point: bond yields dropped again (signalling buying of bonds and rising prices) as the stock market sellers started rotating into the ?safe haven? of bonds.', 'All of this should settle down in a few days with the leveraged traders who were working with short-term borrowings exiting for the time being. With the lower market levels, the long-term cash-buying investors will start factoring in the higher future earnings even with a higher discount rate, and start buying. The markets are likely to remain steady post the transition period, riding on strong fundamentals and reasonable valuations in light of the higher forecast earnings.', 'Vikas Gupta is chief executive officer and chief investment strategist at OmniScience Capital.']"

However, of late, the debate on mutual funds has been centred around the adviser versus distributor or fee versus commission model. While there is merit and propriety in saying that an entity or individual should follow only one model, let?s focus on the bigger picture. It is about the spread of awareness about market-driven investments, vis-à-vis physical or contractual return avenues, through the vehicle of mutual funds. This is challenging, given the high levels of financial illiteracy even in urban areas.', 'Having said that, if it has to be done, it has to be done through mutual funds because direct exposure to equity or bonds can be an even bigger challenge for the un-initiated investor.', 'The numbers on asset growth are there: as per the Association of Mutual Funds of India (Amfi), assets under management (AUM) from B15, as of end-December 2017, were Rs4.2 trillion, up from Rs2.86 trillion as of end-December 2016. The report further says, B15 locations have a better balance of equity and non-equity assets?60% of the assets from B15 locations are in equity schemes. Equity-oriented schemes accounted for 36% of the T15 assets. Another driver for the increase in B15 AUM, apart from what is mentioned earlier, has been the easing of returns from traditional contractual-return products and the booming equity market.', 'On a different note, a paper by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) says: ?The significant increase in inflows into mutual funds and their subsequent deployment is altering the scope of disintermediation in India?, which is an objective of the RBI. The paper further says, ?...plenty of scope for potential movement of borrowers away from banks to mutual funds.? So the move is welcome.', 'Let?s move from ?India? to ?Bharat?, that is, from urban or semi-urban to rural areas. From the top 15 cities, to not just the leading B15 cities, but beyond. This is where the crux of the matter is, as well as the challenge.', 'The first brush of financialization of investments of the average middle class or lower middle class first-time investors, moving from physical to the financial, is with the post office or a public sector bank (they have branches at remote locations) or the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC, which is distinct from the private sector insurers, and enjoys an implied government patronage).', 'The first step is moving the savings from town or villages, in the form of investment in physical assets like land or gold, to the formal system through bank deposits or an insurance policy. The next step is moving from contractual-return investments like bank deposits to market-driven investments like equity or debt.', 'The stepping stone to market-driven investments in beyond B15 (BB15) locations has to be mutual funds, as these are managed by professionals and they offer small ticket sizes for investments. But what is the incentive for mutual funds to spread business in remote locations? The current incentive for promoting business in B15 areas is being allowed to charge a little higher expense, provided they do the stipulated minimum volume of business from B15. However, given that the expenses are anyway within the stipulated limits in most cases, it does not mean much in practical terms.', 'The advertisement campaign of ?Mutual FundsSahi Hai?, initiated subsequent to bifurcation of the corpus generated from charging 2 basis points to fund expenses, between Amfi and asset management companies (AMCs), has helped. The ?language? of the campaign, being simple and on the ground, has been digested well by the target audience. (One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point).', 'More is required. There is need for touchpoints for the masses, where someone will explain and sensitize people on what are market-related investments. There are investor awareness programmes organized by mutual funds,  but there is need for something more institutionalized, more regular and more visible?like a bank branch or an LIC office, with dedicated resources. It has to be done with a non-commercial approach, that is, not for immediate conversion of the query to investment but with a long-term view of spreading awareness. If it has to be institutionalized in terms of the content and communication, Amfi has to take the lead. With the corpus generated from bifurcation of the 2 basis points of expenses charged, Amfi has the leeway to at least start a pilot project in certain remote locations.', 'Mutual funds on their part, as an allocation of the marketing budget, can distribute one free unit of a fund of their choice. They can also take up a few pilot locations for distribution of one free unit to bank account holders, to give a flavour of how market-driven investments work, preferably at a location where Amfi is setting up a representative office.', 'The long-term benefit of the concerted effort should be cost-effective.', 'Joydeep Sen is founder, wiseinvestor.in']"

To component manufacturers like us that are engine agnostic, this is an added opportunity. Electric vehicles (EVs) will need increased light-weighting, more sophisticated and aesthetic plastics. So in the pure sense, the advent of EVs is an extension of what we are already doing.', 'We must remember that EVs are not as recent as we seem to think they are.

I expect the pattern to repeat this time once the government announces MSP fixing sometime in Q1FY19","['The monetary policy committee (MPC) kept policy rates and stance unchanged in its sixth bimonthly policy review, in line with consensus expectations. The policy statement was more balanced than anticipated by bond markets, leading to a relief rally in bonds. In terms of macro projections, MPC revised down both FY18 and FY19 GVA (gross value added) estimates by 10 basis points (bps) and 20bps respectively. Conversely, it revised up Q4FY18 and H1FY19 inflation estimates while keeping Q4FY19 estimates constant.', 'MPC?s inflation forecasts are somewhat inexplicable in my view. For one it has decided to look through the HRA (house rent allowance) effect in pushing up headline inflation in the 12-month period from August 2017 to July 2018.', 'However, the favourable base effects of the higher inflation that will be felt in H2FY19 is internalized in the inflation projections. Second, even including the HRA effect, MPC may be lowballing the Q1FY19 inflation at 5.6%. I see peak inflation in Q1FY19 at 6%, implying a higher average as well. It is likely that MPC?s inflation forecast is under-emphasizing the impact of higher crude prices and fiscal slippage.', 'For instance, global crude prices are up nearly 40% from July 2017; however, domestic pump prices are up only 10% in this period. Even on a conservative basis if one assumes another 10% rise in prices from here, headline inflation would be higher by about 20bps. Similarly, going by RBI?s research on inflation impact of fiscal slippage, the slippages in FY18 and FY19 should add another 15bps. Lastly, the new formula for fixing MSPs could cause inflation to go up by around 35bps. Put all this together and CPI inflation will likely touch 5% by Q4FY19. In fact, if one takes cleaner gauges of CPI excluding housing, the average inflation could be higher than 5% in that period.', 'In the past, MPC has shown flexibility in changing its inflation forecasts as data comes in. I expect the pattern to repeat this time once the government announces MSP fixing sometime in Q1FY19. Accordingly, I expect MPC to begin hiking policy rates with a 25bps hike in August this year. By then, there will be enough evidence of growth picking up on the back of recovery in consumption and exports. The only pushback against a hike by then would come if MPC has informally decided to dilute its insistence on hitting the 4% target in a durable manner. The committee may decide to allow inflation to be in the 4-6% target in order to support growth, given the fragile nature of the economy.', 'Indeed, looking at the pragmatic nature of the February policy statement, that could be a reasonable conclusion. However, I believe that MPC cannot afford to lower its guard on inflation especially when the government has pushed back the timeline for fiscal consolidation. Further global inflation pressures may be poised to rise given the tightening labour market in the US and the synchronized global recovery underway. As such, abandoning both fiscal and inflation targets at the same time could cause India to lose its cachet among foreign investors. While policy should be driven largely by domestic considerations, the global context cannot be lost sight of particularly when developed country central banks have started normalizing monetary policies.', 'Apart from policy stance and macro estimates, the interest of the market centred on RBI?s commentary about recent hardening of yields. In the event, both the governor and deputy governor negated the need for any extraordinary measures by pointing to global and domestic factors that triggered the rise in yields. This ensures that the bond market will have to find its own level in an environment of better growth, creeping inflation and higher deficits. As such, I expect the benchmark 10-year bond yield to trade in the 7.25-8% range in FY19. One source of relief could come if RBI decides to allow higher foreign portfolio investor participation in government bonds. However, I expect such a move to be paired with a road map for further reduction in banks? SLR and HTM limits. All said, higher interest rates are a reality, even if MPC decides to take its time in changing policy rates.', 'A. Prasanna is the chief economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership.']"

TV18 said it has increased its stake in the company to 51% by acquiring 1% of Viacom18?s equity from Viacom for a cash consideration of $20 million. That is not all. Viacom and Viacom18 have also extended their brand and content licence agreement by 10 years after the original 10-year agreement expired this year.', 'Currently, Viacom18 runs 42 channels in seven languages and has interests in television broadcasting, films, digital, merchandising and live events. In India, TV18 and Viacom18 also have a JV called IndiaCast for distribution of TV channels.', 'In 2016-17, Viacom18 had reported a revenue of Rs3,040.7 crore.

It was a sudden, albeit pleasant, development as it will have far-reaching implications on the day-to-day operations of Viacom18. An executive at Viacom18, on condition of anonymity, said that the step was a big deal for Mukesh Ambani?s Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), which owns TV18. RIL now has a majority stake in the venture.', 'For starters, this means that decision-making at Viacom18 will be speedier. Earlier, for any decision taken by Viacom18, Viacom needed to be consulted as it was an equal JV partner. ?Now there is only one driver in the driving seat,? said the Viacom18 executive. Quicker decision-making may translate into greater efficiency. While TV18 is in the driver?s seat as the majority shareholder, it enjoys the benefits of Viacom?s pedigree, which continues to stay invested as a 49% shareholder and has agreed to share content for another 10 years.', 'Top Viacom18 officials refuse to share details on how the deal may have come about. However, it is possible that RIL may have asked for a controlling stake as it understands the Indian media and entertainment market better than its American JV partner. In any case, the Indian television channels in the JV, namely Colors, Rishtey, Cineplex and the Colors regional bouquet are outperforming the international brands such as MTV, Nickelodeon and VH1. According to media industry estimates, the Indian channels contribute between 75% and 80% of the total revenue of Viacom18.', 'As a controlling partner, RIL can fully exploit the synergy with its telecom brand Jio, which will have more content than any other telco. Media experts say that Jio and Viacom18 could script a very successful convergence story. ?The two businesses complement each other and offer a strategic advantage. For RIL it is a fantastic decision,? said the Viacom18 executive quoted above.', 'Since RIL likes to be a big player in everything it does, it may invest in and scale up the media and entertainment business, too.', 'In fact, Viacom18?s expansion plans could get a boost. In an earlier interview, Sudhanshu Vats, group CEO of Viacom18, had said that it will launch a Tamil entertainment channel in the March quarter. Besides it had plans to move some part of its over-the-top video streaming platform Voot behind a paywall. ?We will have a dedicated offering for kids?with more content, e-books and light gaming. That will be behind a paywall,? Vats had said.', 'Viacom18 is not present in sports broadcasting. Although Vats had said that in India sports is largely cricket and cricket is a very high-investment, long-gestation game, last week he announced a tie-up with DSport, the sports channel of Discovery Communications, whereby it will telecast the Nidahas Trophy 2018 on two of its Hindi entertainment channels?Rishtey Cineplex and Cineplex HD. While DSport will telecast the cricket tri-series between India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka with English commentary, the Viacom18 channels will have the commentary in Hindi. Explaining the rationale behind the partnership, Vats said in a statement: ?Sports?represents a sizeable opportunity, but the cost of entry tends to be prohibitive. It has been a white space that we have continuously been evaluating and this association with DSport to air the Nidahas tri-series provides us with a fertile testing ground. As we endeavour to test waters with our very first broadcast of an international sporting property, what better than a cricket tri-series involving the national team.?', 'With the 51% stake in Viacom18, RIL is now a serious contender in media and entertainment.

Equally, among the most aggressive inputs will be from Goa Foundation, which advocates the idea of intergenerational equity and shared wealth, quite the other end of the spectrum.', 'The principle of intergenerational equity assumes that natural resources are a commons in which the stake of future generations must be secured. Indeed, the draft policy acknowledges it. ?There is a need to understand that natural resources, including minerals, are a shared inheritance where the state is the trustee on behalf of the people to ensure that future generations receive the benefit of inheritance,? the draft policy states. It adds: ?State governments will endeavour to ensure that the full value of the extracted minerals is received by the State.? The draft policy suggests that on account of varying levels of reserves, each mineral be treated differently but with the same underlying principle.', 'It wouldn?t be an exaggeration to say that Goa Foundation?s relentless pursuit of intergenerational equity, and that of a collaborative initiative it spearheads, Goenchi Mati (literally, Goan Earth) Movement has escalated matters.

It argues for fair mining that extracts the value of a resource to the fullest. That naturally comes after respecting free, prior and informed consent of communities where a project is located, and following the strictest practicable environmental norms. Goenchi Mati advocates what it terms ?full economic rent (sale price minus cost of extraction, cost including reasonable profit for miner).?

In line with our expectations, it left the repo rate unchanged at 6%, retained the neutral stance of monetary policy and reiterated the commitment toward achieving the medium-term inflation target of 4%.', 'As anticipated, the decision to keep the repo rate unchanged was not unanimous, with one MPC member voting for a hike of 25 basis points (bps). Additionally, the inflation forecast for Q4 FY2018 was revised upward, while the baseline expectation for GVA growth for FY2018 was pared mildly.', 'However, the tone of the policy outlook was less hawkish than what the markets had started to fear. The caution regarding the need for vigilance around the evolving inflation scenario clouded by upside risks was counterbalanced by the emphasis on nurturing the nascent recovery through conducive and stable macro-financial management.', 'To recap, the CPI inflation spiked to 5.2% in December 2017, overshooting MPC?s earlier forecast. In maintaining status quo, MPC appears to have looked through the impact of the revision in house rent allowance (HRA) for central government employees on the uptick in the CPI inflation. Moreover, the presence of mitigants, such as subdued capacity utilization, moderate rural wage growth and the possibility of crude oil prices receding from current levels, supported MPC?s decision to maintain rates and persist with the neutral stance.', 'Nevertheless, the sixth bi-monthly policy statement highlighted various risks, including the first and second round impact of the staggered revision in HRA by state governments; the possibility that firms may pass on higher global commodity prices to consumers; and the proposals made in the Union budget for FY2019 to augment minimum support prices (MSP), increase customs duty on certain items, and delay fiscal consolidation. In particular, MPC commented that the fiscal slippage has started to raise economy-wide costs of borrowing, which may spark inflationary pressures going forward. Based on these risks, MPC revised its inflation estimate for Q4 FY2018 (including the HRA impact) to 5.1%, above its earlier forecast of 4.3-4.7% for H2 FY2018. Moreover, it expects CPI inflation to harden to 5.1-5.6% in H1 FY2019, followed by a moderation to 4.5-4.6% in H2 FY2019, albeit with risks tilted to the upside. The expected softening in inflation in H2 FY2019 is attributed a favourable base effect related to the waning impact of the HRA revision from July 2018 onwards, and the expectation that a normal monsoon and effective supply management would dampen food inflation. Overall, MPC emphasized caution about the evolving inflation scenario.', 'MPC mildly revised its baseline expectation for GVA growth for FY2018 to 6.6% from 6.7%. It pegged the GVA growth forecast for FY2019 at 7.2% with risks evenly balanced, with an anticipated easing from 7.3-7.4% in H1 FY2019 to 7.1-7.2% in H2 FY2019. It attributed the improvement in FY2019 GVA growth to factors such as the stabilization of the economy after the transition to GST; signs of a nascent investment revival provided by rising credit growth, equity fundraising, imports and capital goods production; the ongoing recapitalisation of public sector banks; and the prospect of rising exports on the back of an improving global economy. However, it warned of downside risks from the deterioration in public finances, which might crowd out private financing and investment.', 'Looking ahead, the emphasis placed by the committee on nurturing the fledgling recovery and on stability suggests that it would prefer to wait for additional data on the extent to which the upside risks to inflation materialize. Therefore, it is unlikely to hike rates in the immediate term, in our view. However, if CPI inflation exceeds MPC?s forecast in a sustained manner, a rate hike toward the second half of 2018 may not be ruled out.', 'The softer-than-expected tone of the policy document should help to contain yields of government securities (G-secs) to some extent, even though the prospects of open market operations being conducted by the central bank to purchase G-secs appear dim. Regardless, global trends related to liquidity, inflation and interest rates would continue to influence the direction of Indian bond yields in the near term.', 'Aditi Nayar is principal economist at Icra.']"

If the headline CPI inflation follows the guidance path, then a prolonged pause on policy rates will remain as the base case","['The monetary policy committee in its last meeting for the financial year voted to keep the repo rate unchanged at 6% and maintain a neutral stance. The accompanying statement struck a balanced tone, pointing out that while the risks to inflation are on the upside and hence vigilance is required, a nascent recovery is in the offing and that needs to be supported too. The decision was, however, not unanimous as one member voted for a 25 basis points rate hike. The underlying growth and inflation forecasts and the uncertainties around the inflation outlook seem to have prompted the majority of the MPC to seek more clarity through income data and other developments.', 'The guidance on the future path of inflation is cautious. Headline CPI inflation is expected to rise from an average of 4.6% in Q3 to 5.1% in Q4 and range between 5.1% and 5.6% in the first half of FY19, before easing to 4.5-4.6% in the second half. The balance of risks to this trajectory are on the upside and emanate from higher oil prices, rising non-oil inputs costs being passed to output prices and elevated household inflation expectations. Overall inflation outlook is subject to significant uncertainty from the staggered impact of implementation of HRA hikes by states, fiscal slippage, and changing expectations about the pace of global monetary policy normalization. The statement also notes that the new guidelines for fixing MSPs for the kharif crop in 2018 is an area of uncertainty and any impact assessment on inflation is difficult at this stage.', 'Interestingly, easing inflation in the second half of the next fiscal year assumes softer food inflation, and that may actually turn out to be the key source of upward drift from the RBI?s trajectory. It is reasonable to assume that the under the new formula and ahead of the national elections next year, average MSP increases may turn out to be larger than what the government has provided in the last four years. That, in turn, would stoke food inflation even with a normal monsoon and lead to higher-than-anticipated inflation. It thus appears that while the balance of risks is seen on the upside, the overall approach on the future guidance on inflation is less conservative than in the past.', 'Balancing its concerns on inflation, MPC also acknowledged that economic recovery is in a nascent stage and needs to be supported. RBI projects real GVA growth to pick up to 7.2% in FY19, up from 6.6% growth forecast in the current fiscal and the risks to this growth path are evenly balanced.', 'RBI continues to project higher growth in FY18 versus the CSO?s advance estimate of 6.1%. Signs of revival in investment activity and stabilization of GST implementation, are seen driving growth higher over this year and the next. This appears to be a reasonable estimate of growth, considering the recent improvement in manufacturing sector activity and a synchronized pick-up in global economic activity. However, weak private services sector activity (as seen from PMI services reading hovering close to the 50 mark) and the drag from net external demand are something which could impart some downside to this forecast.', 'Going forward, the path of monetary policy would be dependent on how the actual inflation and GDP growth evolve. If the headline CPI inflation follows the guidance path, then a prolonged pause on policy rates will remain as the base case. However, the upside risks to inflation (especially from food inflation and rising commodity prices) may outweigh the downside from low capacity utilization and possible correction in oil prices. The likelihood of actual inflation drifting towards the upper level of the inflation tolerance band (6%) has therefore increased. That may call for not only vigilance on inflation but a pre-emptive rate hike in July or August without changing the neutral stance. For the policy stance to change to hawkish, not only do some of the inflation risks have to gain strength, but even the growth out-turn has to be better than the RBI projections, thereby stoking demand-push inflation.', 'Gaurav Kapur is the chief economist of IndusInd Bank Ltd.

Zhou, who just turned 70, appears to have engineered a path for Guo Shuqing, a reform-minded, former People?s Bank of China (PBOC) deputy, to replace him. That?s comforting news, allaying fears President Xi Jinping might install a yes-man in the pivotal job. Tapping Guo is a clear sign Xi means to accelerate financial upgrades.', 'That?s a short-term negative for Asia, but a huge positive in the medium-to-long term. Any serious drive to recalibrate growth engines from excessive credit and investment to services will slow gross domestic product?probably to well below 6%. A positive because China getting a handle on duelling bubbles in credit, debt, property and pollution will stabilize Asia?s biggest economy, avoiding a Japan-like crash.', 'Caveats abound, of course. Anyone who thinks the process will be smooth and orderly is dreaming. China?s $38 trillion banking systems, with its M.C. Escher world of shadow banks, off-balance-sheet vehicles and state-owned enterprises, is the quintessential financial riddle. The closer you look, the more bizarre things seem.

De-pegging the yuan from the dollar in 2006 bore his fingerprints. So did moves since then to liberalize the capital account, scrap deposit rate caps and get the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to include the yuan in its top-five currency list. Zhou also was instrumental to China navigating around the worst of 2008 Lehman Brothers crisis.', 'In recent years, though, Beijing shifted from retooling to stimulus?in a big way, adding tens of trillions of dollars in new credit. In November, for example, China continued to hit fresh credit-expansion records?$170 billion that month ?despite assertive efforts to clamp down on financial excesses. At the same time, even the good news can seem bad. Case in point: the amount of fresh credit needed to gin up $1 of output was about 28 cents last year, compared with 30 cents in 2016. Still, it?s high by developing-economy standards.', 'Guo?s eclectic resume could make him uniquely qualified to impose some lending sobriety. Along with serving as vice PBOC governor, Guo has been governor of Shandong province, chairman of China Construction Bank, head securities regular and directed the state agency that oversees Beijing?s $3 trillion of currency reserves. At the CBRC, Guo has gone after industry malpractice, rejiggered lending practices and made cross-holdings of financial products less opaque.', '?If Guo is appointed, it will be a ringing endorsement by Xi of his energetic approach to tackling reform in the financial sector, and Guo will lead that position from the PBOC,? says Evan Medeiros, managing director, Asia, at Eurasia Group.', 'Guo is also proving to be a bit of a hunter?of so-called gray rhinos.

HNA alone is shopping around about $16 billion of asset sales in the next few months.', 'China faces daunting challenges in 2018, and numerous things could go awry, including US President Donald Trump waging a trade or currency war. Yet, it?s heartening to see Xi leaning toward a PBOC successor with an intimate understanding of the mechanics behind China?s credit and debt excesses.

The inadequacy of our present infrastructure, however, cannot be an excuse for creating a below-par infrastructure that is in frequent need of repair or upgrades.', 'In fact, the current government?s focus on transforming infrastructure, which includes housing for all and smart cities, presents an unprecedented opportunity to build or upgrade existing urban and civil infrastructure that is world-class in terms of efficiency and safety.', 'To do so, we need to first reorient our construction goals and commit to performance metrics that emphasize safety, efficiency and longevity of infrastructure projects as much as the speed and time of project completion. Once these metrics are in place, the actual execution is relatively straightforward?with judicious application of specialized technology in constructing or maintaining the infrastructure.', 'Consider the example of roads, where right grading and compacting (using a road roller) of the surface before and after road construction makes all the difference between producing a road surface that is smooth, wobble-free and lasts for years versus one that is undulated, gets water logged and withers away in the first heavy rain. Advanced machine-control technologies available today allow global positioning system (GPS)-enabled precise and automated control of hydro-mechanical components of construction equipment for highly accurate grading and compacting. Contrast this with manual compacting that involves little precision for the person driving the road roller, and depends solely on his instinct or skill to determine how many times the surface should be rolled. In fact, once the grading and road-rolling equipment is automated and remotely controlled, precise values fed into the system are able to create safer and durable world-class roads.', 'In case of railway infrastructure, which is in dire need of an upgrade, safety is perhaps an even more critical consideration. Derailments, which in turn are frequently caused by fractures in railway lines, have been responsible for more than half of 586 railway accidents in the last five years, according to a 20 August report inHindustan Times. Today, we have sensors that can continually monitor track movement in real time and raise alerts in case of any cracks or abnormality, thus allowing the signalling room to stop the train and prevent a derailment. When deployed on flood-prone roads and bridges, these sensors can raise alerts to slow down or restrict rail or road traffic?or stop it altogether in case of a grave threat.', 'Structural monitoring is useful when new metro lines or flyovers are being added in congested areas; but it is more critical in the vicinity of many old or heritage buildings (as is the case in Mumbai today), or in case of dilapidated buildings in seismically active places like in Delhi. Every monsoon, dozens of old or dilapidated buildings collapse in cities across India. Imagine how many lives could be saved if our municipalities mandated the use of structural monitoring systems in buildings older than a prescribed age and evacuate their occupants well in time when the sensors raise an alert?', 'These monitoring systems typically consist of high resolution strong motion recorders (to detect seismic activity), total stations (electronic/optical instruments used in modern surveying and building construction) and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers feeding data into an advanced monitoring software solution. They can also detect minute changes in a building?s structural and position parameters due to tunnelling or digging and can help the authorities ensure that existing buildings stand their ground unmoved by the vibrations.', 'For example, in the US, the California Strong Motion Instrumentation Program (CSMIP) records the strong shaking of the ground and structures during earthquakes through a state-wide network of strong motion instruments?California being the most seismically active of all the 50 US states. CSMIP maintains recording instruments at more than 1,150 locations state-wide, including the city halls of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Oakland, and at the State Capitol. A number of high-rises, dams and all major bridges are instrumented. Similar systems monitor buildings, including prestigious landmarks in Australia and New Zealand, including Te Puna o Waiwhetu, Christchurch?s main art gallery, which is otherwise designed to withstand earthquakes.', 'The contrast with India is stark, however, as we have collectively often neglected infrastructure safety. In a majority of projects, safety for the end-user is more of a regulatory afterthought?a list where boxes must be ticked rather than safety being an absolute precondition for design and execution.

Just last month, Singapore Exchange Ltd (SGX) told investors it had garnered a 52% share of global Nifty futures volumes, up from 47% a year ago. And combined with Dubai Gold and Commodities Exchange (DGCX), offshore centres have nearly caught up with Indian exchanges in dollar-rupee trading.', 'Encouraged by the success, SGX has launched futures contracts on 50 leading Indian stocks since 5 February. A big factor that works in its favour is Singapore?s taxation policy, which exempts capital gains tax and doesn?t impose a securities transaction tax (STT). In contrast, India now has the rare distinction of imposing both forms of taxation.', 'While offshore centres have become increasingly attractive to trade Indian assets, the irony is that they haven?t done anything spectacular to attract order flow. Thanks to a number of policy missteps, India has been gifting its financial market to centres such as SGX one product at a time.Last year, a flawed policy on the use of participatory notesdrove away overseas participants to offshore centres. This year?s contribution is flawed tax policy.', 'Arvind Virmani, a former chief economic advisor in the finance ministry says, ?Without tax economists who can analyse the effect of different taxes on incentives, efficiency and equity, we are doomed to stumble from one tax mistake to another.? The government hasn?t employed tax economists for years now, which isleading to mistakes in other areas as well.', 'J.R. Varma, a professor of finance at IIM Ahmedabad, says, ?Over the last decade or more, tax policy has become primarily focused on revenue generation with too little attention to either fairness or economic efficiency.?', 'The government?s stance that exempting LTCG on equities is inequitable, especially when all other asset classes are taxed, is just one part of the picture?the revenue generation part. It brushes aside the double taxation argument against LTCG, for one. Urjit Patel, governor of Reserve Bank of India, even says that equity capital is taxed as many as five times in India, and that this can have an impact on investment decisions. Patel, incidentally, was part of the Vijay Kelkar task force on direct taxesthat had recommended abolishing LTCG to avoid double taxation.', 'The fact that it works against the interests of India?s financial markets is another important aspect to consider. ?STT is a tax on transactions and disincentivises transactions. Transactions will move to other jurisdictions if this is possible and if the cost of doing so is less than the cost of STT. This is perfectly predictable. The 10% LTCG will increase the incentive to shift trading to other jurisdictions,? points out Virmani.', 'Does this mean the government is oblivious of the international implications of changes in taxation policy or is it just giving the threat from offshore centres a nonchalant shrug? Not quite. It has a plan B to bring back volumes from offshore centres.', 'While trading in the mainland exchanges has become more taxing, the government has brought exchanges situated in international financial services centres (IFSCs) on par with offshore centres. Traders in these exchanges were already exempt from STT and LTCG; in last week?s budget, the finance minister also waived short-term capital gains taxes.', 'From the looks and sound of it, NSE and BSE will primarily rely on their exchanges running out of the IFSC in Gift City to win back volumes from offshore centres. ?Gift City has the solutions to some of the problems that drove volumes offshore,? says an exchange official. This is bizarre, to say the least. It?s worse than sending your B team to the World Cup. ?Gandhinagar is not seen as a financial centre; and people want to work in a financial centre where all linkages such as law firms etc. are in place,? says the head of one of India?s largest trading firms.', 'He adds that just as the IFSC in Dubai is an extension of the existing marketplace in the city, an IFSC that worked as an extension of the markets in Mumbai would have been far more viable.', 'In any case, relying on plan B or team B is flawed thinking, because this effectively means that India?s main markets will continue to get hollowed out. Whether traders use SGX or an exchange in Gift City, the fact remains that exchanges in the mainland will be hurt. Of course, since most domestic retail investors don?t have access to either offshore centres or IFSCs, existing markets won?t be completely hollowed out. And as they did with STT, some trading firms will build the additional cost into their models and move on. But liquidity can weaken over time, which will hurt price discovery.', 'One big worry with a policy stance that promotes IFSCs is that there will be no urgency to fix the gaps in the mainstay markets. Another concern related to their promotion is what the next course of action could be if tax incentives don?t do the trick. If, for instance, regulatory oversight is not maintained at stringent levels, with a view to attract order flow, it will be a huge disaster in the making. As argued in this column earlier, a far more practical alternative is to strengthen India?s existing markets. The fact that the government seems to be doing the opposite shows that it?s time to heed Virmani?s call and bring back tax economists into the policy making process.']"

Or may be a return to our roots. Or it could simply be good business sense, or perhaps philanthropy. But when Baba Ramdev announced\xa0in January that he would turn his Patanjali Ayurved Ltd into a non-profit entity, making charitable organization Patanjali Seva Trust its holding company, he wasn?t the first to do so.', 'Way back in 1906, before India got freedom and when Pakistan and India were undivided, Hafiz Abdul Majeed, then 23, started a Unani clinic in Delhi and went on to standardize and sell packaged Unani products such as Rooh Afza, a fruit-based drink, and Roghan Badam Shirin, cold-pressed almond oil, Safi, a blood purifier and Cinkara, an energy drink. There were Unani practitioners and clinics present across the country.', 'In 1962, the company set up the Hamdard National Foundation, which carried out the organization?s charity work. The Hamdard trust looked at issues of minorities and worked on safeguarding traditional medical systems. It set up the Institute of History of Medicine and Medical Research (IHMMR) to promote research in Unani medicine. In 1981, the Hamdard Education Society was set up to promote education among marginalized sections of society. Promoter Abdul Hameed received the Padma Shri award in 1965 and the Padma Bhushan in 1992. Various prime ministers and presidents graced the inaugurations of the organization?s hospitals and institutes.', 'Moreover, with Rooh Afza, a drink the manufacturers say contains no artificial flavours, fat or cholesterol, and is made with cooling herbs and used to treat conditions such as heat stroke, dehydration and diarrhoea, the company was well-entrenched in homes across India, Pakistan and Bangladesh in the 1970s and 1980s.', 'Following Partition, the founder?s younger son moved to Pakistan and started over from two rooms in Karachi; the older son remained in India. Likewise, after East Pakistan became Bangladesh in 1971, the company transferred its business there to a local entrepreneur who continues its legacy.', 'Yet, as India modernized, the company struggled as it shied away from its past. According to Santosh Desai, a writer, social commentator and managing director of Future Brands, the company got trapped between the old and the new. It considered its past a constraint and tried to be modern and cool. To be sure, this was the period post-liberalization in 1991 and multinational companies had started to make inroads into the country. Even companies like Dabur India Ltd, set up in 1884, moved away from theirAyurvedic roots and focused instead on being seen as packaged consumer goods makers with a range of herbal and natural products.', 'However, now there is an increasing cost attached to modernity?consumers are concerned about contamination, depletion, pollution and use of chemicals and their side effects.  Environment is threatened with unsustainable production. Moreover, even controversies like the Cola pesticides issue and safety concerns over Nestle?s Maggi noodles have led to consumers feeling that packaged foods from MNCs have either high sodium, potassium, fats or sugar content. Also as consumerism rises, there is attached guilt of consumption.', 'All this has circled back to the emergence of a new set of companies that have embraced\xa0the Indian\xa0tradition and the\xa0production of\xa0natural and herbal products and are celebrating them unapologetically.', 'So, we have Hector Beverages Pvt. Ltd, marketer of the Paper Boat brand which was launched in 2012, which has based its business on marketing\xa0ethnic\xa0drinks evoking nostalgia and childhood memories. This platform, notes K.V. Sridhar, founder and chief creative officer of Hyper Collective, a strategy, communication, content and design platform, could have been claimed by Parle Agro Pvt. Ltd, makers of Frooti or even Dabur and Hamdard as they had the rights to it.', 'Meanwhile, Patanjali Ayurved, which started in 2006, manufactures and sells everything from pulses to ghee, biscuits to shampoo, juices to anti-ageing creams. It has also expressed interest in entering new areas such as infrastructure, solar power and apparel. Also, unlike its predecessor which got limited by its own heritage, Patanjali Ayurved plans to ride the Indianess wave and milk it for all its worth.', 'Shop Talk will take a weekly look at consumer trends, behaviour and insights.']"

More to the point, having a giant like Walmart in its corner will go a long way toward fending off Amazon.com Inc., which itself has pledged to spend $5 billion in the world?s second-most-populous country.', '', 'There was a time when Snapdeal.com would rate a mention in the competitive landscape, but the decision of its founders to veto a merger with Flipkart ? engineered by SoftBank Group Corp. ? relegates that outfit to the sidelines. Eighteen months ago, there was talk of Walmart pumping $1 billion into Flipkart in a move that would have merely inflamed the market. Today, a much bigger investment in what?s almost a two-horse race makes more sense.', 'With Amazon?s rise in the US putting the brakes on Walmart?s revenue growth, which has averaged 3.4% annually over the past decade from 12.8% the prior 10 years, the bricks-and-mortar retailer needs to find fresh ways to fend off The Everything Store. Amazon has little footing in China, which leaves India and its huge middle class. A deal that Walmart signed with Bharti Enterprises Pvt over a decade ago hasn?t amounted to much, so tapping an e-commerce startup is smart.', '', 'Cash isn?t everything to Flipkart. What it can really gain from having a big brother like Walmart is access to a much wider catalog of products, and the negotiating power that comes with $360 million in annual spending. Few suppliers globally don?t hope to sell to Walmart, and with such a tie-up, Flipkart would be on most VIP lists. Walmart would also be aware of the benefits, not least the chance to boost revenue after four years of sub-2% growth.', 'If this deal goes through, you may well expect Flipkart to Save Money, and Walmart to Live Better.Bloomberg Gadfly']"

Famously, and now perhaps dangerously, market volatility has been at all-time lows, at least until the past week.', 'But that, like much else when it comes to the market, is about perception and memory, which is famously short during bull markets but long during bear ones. In fact, this is the fifth correction since 2009, according to Yardeni Research, and as of right now the latest one is the smallest.', 'The S&P 500 Index dropped 19.4% in 2011 before recovering. The index was down 16% during a stretch the year before that, during the European debt crisis.', 'On top of that, there have been a number of close misses and plenty of dips. Remember the debt-ceiling crisis? The market fell 9.8% in late 2011 and 9.9% in the spring of the next year. Four other times since 2009, the S&P was down 5% or more before stopping short of an actual correction. But none of these, not the dips, or the near-misses, or the prior corrections turned into bear markets.', 'What?s more, of the 30 corrections that have happened in the market going back to 1959, just six have turned into full bear markets, meaning stocks fell 20% or more. That being said, corrections matter, because they affect the psychology of investors, and how investors feel has a big impact on what stocks do. They can also act as a release valve, repressurizing the system before it truly blows a gasket.', 'That?s not to say that this correction can?t turn into something worse. Stock drops are important because they can make investors take a hard look at U.S. and global economies to see whether something is out of whack. And at times, like during the financial crisis, and the Asian debt crisis, and to a lesser extent the European debt crisis, there was.', 'This time, the US and global economies look strong, and inflation and interest rates, while rising, are still comparatively low. Stocks are still relatively expensive compared with earnings. A correction can seem scary when the headlines flash, but just remember it?s happened before.
