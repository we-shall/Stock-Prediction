Excerpts:ET Now: The oil ministry on Friday clearly indicated that a fuel price hike is being considered. Have you heard anything from the ministry on that?RK Singh:If a minister has made a statement, I cannot add or delete anything from there, but all I know is that there is some proposal only. This is a proposal stage. I am not party to such a decision. I am only hearing from the newspapers and from you people. Now that you have heard from the minister, that must be true.ET Now: So assuming a price hike does not or rather does come about, what has been talked about in terms ofrupeeper month on diesel, what is going to be the impact of it?RK Singh:If that indeed gets done, I am not sure because I told you this is a proposal I have heard about. And as you said the minister has made such a statement. I take it that it must be true. If that does happen and if the crude prices remain at this level and rupee-dollar exchange rate also does not fluctuate much, it remains at the same rate as it is today, then the increase of Re 1 per month will wipe out the entire under-recovery in a year or so.That will certainly increase the cash position of the oil companies because right now we are compensated by the government and money comes late and in the interim period we have to borrow heavily from the banks at very high interest rates. All these problems will be resolved to a large extent because cash positions of oil companies will improve, thereby the borrowing will come down and we will be able to mobilise working capital through own sources.ET Now: But does it look realistic -- Re 1 per month on diesel -- given the kind of political compulsions we have?RK Singh:To me it does not look unrealistic at all. If any government or anybody increases the price by Rs 10 in one go, that will be a chaotic situation and people will feel the shock, but if you do it in a phased manner, people will get adjusted to it and it will not be a sudden shock to the economy. So it is a good move. I entirely agree with that if it happens and it will be good for theeconomy, good for the country, and good for the oil companies.ET Now: There are also reports that probably the government will reform the formula according to whichunder-recoveriesare being calculated, this also may lead to low under recoveries. What are your thoughts if this proposal is to be considered?RK Singh:I am not aware of any such proposal that the formula calculating the under-recovery is being reviewed or changed, but currently marketing companies are paying a price to the refineries what we call is refinery gate price and on that they are adding their normal marketing margins and the cost, cost of distribution and that is how we determine the sales price. And we are selling below the actual price. That is under-recovery that we talk about. I do not know where the mistake is. If there are some changes taking place in the refinery gate price formula that is a different thing. Actually it is a trade parity that we are paying to the refining companies. If there is any such change, the government or whoever is going to make the change will have to examine the refinery profitability as well because we have to make heavy investment in the refinery sector and we have to invest in the marketing infrastructure. So I do not think money can be mobilised if we tinker with the refinery gate price.']"

""Although it is unclear how much leeway the companies will get in determining the amount and timing of the diesel price revisions, the authorization marks the first time that they are able to raise prices,"" Moody\'s said.Following the news, shares of all the three oil & gas companies surged over 10 per cent last week. For the year 2013, BPCL surged over 20 per cent, HPCL managed to clock a return on 28 per cent while IOC rose over 27 per cent compared to a 3 per cent rise in the benchmark index in the same period.The rating agency is of the view that this partial freeing up of diesel prices is a positive step for BPCL and IOC towards recovering the Rs 9.60 per litre loss they incur on the sale of diesel.Moody\'s expects BPCL\'s and IOC\'s credit metrics to improve as diesel prices rise. The subsidy on diesel alone is worth Rs 94,000 crore per year. All three government-owned oil marketing companies share the risk associated with a largely ad-hoc mechanism for subsidy reimbursement.According to the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, the under-recoveries to the three oil marketing companies have been rising over the past three years. For the nine months ending 31 December, diesel composed 59 per cent of the companies\' total under-recoveries of Rs 1.25 billion.Last week different brokerage firms came out with their recommendations post the partial-deregulations. We take a look at a few of them:Nomura:The brokerage firm said the rally in state-run oil companies, spurred by the government\'s announcement to allow higher diesel prices, was excessive and the action would not lead to any improvement in the bottom line of these companies.Nomura maintains its \'reduce\' rating onOil and Natural GasCorp andOil India Ltd.Deutsche BankThe global bank expects the decision of the government to ease the process of diesel price revision as it does not have to be referred to the Cabinet for approval. Deutsche Bank also believes that if the diesel price is raised regularly, even if the increase is as small as less than Rs 0.5/litre per month, it will be a positive step to reduce fuel subsidies benefitingONGC, OIL andGAIL.CLSA:The experience with petrol and a busy 2013 political calendar make it doubt any significant follow up in price hike. The oil & gas stocks are euphoric and already building in 3-16 months of price hikes,CLSAsaid in a report.At current rupee and crude assumptions, CLSA expects the under-recoveries to decline to Rs 852 billion. Keeping upstream sharing at 40 per cent, it expects 62/73 per cent upgrade in EPS of ONGC (Rs 20) and OIL (Rs 45).The brokerage firm finds IOC (GRM of $5.2/bbl) and HPCL (GRM of $4.8/bbl) near peer multiples and sees upsides capped even in this blue sky case. CLSA continues to prefer BPCL in the R&M; space due to its upstream footprint.JPMorganGlobal brokerage firm, JPMorgan is cautious on the refining and marketing space (R&M;) as implementation of hike in diesel prices remains vague - leading to potential for delays.JPMorgan remains cautious on the R&M; space and prefers BPCL for its upstream leverage.

Nevertheless, they seem to have been fully compensated for the Oct-Dec '12 quarter.The three OMCs -IndianOil,BPCLandHPCL- received adequate compensation from the government and upstream companies to cover their losses, unlike the inadequate compensation of the earlier two quarters.Industry leader IndianOil, which had lost a net Rs 13,635 crore in the April-September 2012 period, reported a drop in net under-recovery at Rs 13,227 crore for the 9-month period (April-December 2012).

As a result, the March '13 quarter will be an important one for the industry.IndianOil was the only company to post a jump in profits for the December '12 quarter with BPCL and HPCL witnessing sharp reduction on a y-o-y basis. However, this was mainly due toIOCwriting off Rs 6,168 crore towards entry-tax arrears under litigation in Uttar Pradesh.On the other hand, what the companies have received for the October-December 2012 quarter is just an assurance letter from the government towards the compensation and not the actual cash.The cash would be paid only afterParliamentapprovessupplementary budget expenditure.

Excerpts:ET Now: First a word on the new discovery which you have announced two-three days ago, the offshore area of the Rovuma Basin.RK Singh: As you know, we have drilled a number of wells there earlier and there have been discoveries. The reserve estimated is in the range of 35 tcf to 65 tcf. Some more wells in the neighbouring areas were to be drilled, which has been done now and there has been a fresh discovery in one of the wells called Orca. That is what we have announced, but we need to drill two more appraisal wells to actually estimate the amount of gas that would be available in addition to what we have announced already.ET Now: So with this new discovery in place, how does the total potential of the block look like?RK Singh: As I told you, the quantity estimated so far and announced by the operator is in the range of 35 to 65 tcf, but other than that, this is a fresh discovery which will add to the number already announced by us. But how much is yet to be assessed because we need to drill two more appraisal wells in the same vicinity. After that only we should be able to tell you as to how much additionality will be there.ET Now: So what is the development plan of the main operator? Are there chances of more recoveries from the Rovuma Basin?RK Singh: Yes, indeed. Some more wells are yet to be drilled. So my own guess is (the operator has not announced, but I am just guessing the figure being part of the consortium) that it can go in excess of 100 tcf. The final reserve that we are talking about it can go up to 100 or in excess of 100 tcf. The development plan is that initially we are all planning to put up two trains of LNG for liquefaction of the gas that is available and the total development expenditure estimated including that of the terminal and liquefaction plant is estimated to be about $20 billion. Our share will be of course $2 billion. So the first two trains for the liquefaction transportation will be ready by 2017-2018.ET Now: So with crude oil prices coming down, how much are you benefiting in terms of low under recoveries?RK Singh: Losses have indeed come down. When you talk about them, basically there is under recovery on diesel which used to be Rs 10-12 with the latest reduction in crude price as also the product price. I have not worked out the exact number because we do it every fortnightly, but as indications are it could be around Rs 4 to Rs 5 per litre. If the prices continue to slide, as they are today or if they remain at today's level, the under-recovery on diesel could be in the range of Rs 4 to Rs 5 as against Rs 11-12 earlier. Of course there is no under recovery on petrol and likewise the prices of kerosene and LPG have also come down, but we would let you know the exact reduction maybe after the fortnight or by the end of this month.""]"

Furthermore, in the absence of any further diesel price hikes, fuel subsidies would increase an additional Rs 151 billion.To contain thefiscal deficit, the government has introduced a slew of reforms ranging from increase in fuel prices, withdrawing subsidy on diesel sold in bulk and limiting LPG sold at subsidized rates.But a sharp fall in the rupee has reversed the equation for oil marketing companies.A sharp depreciation in the rupee would also result in translation losses on existing foreign-currency borrowings and consequently their balance of foreign-currency borrowings will increase.Moody's estimates the foreign-currency borrowings of the three oil marketing companies at $17.5 bn (Rs 950 bn at a rate of 54.28/USD) as of March 2013, which translates into Rs 1,062 billion at the current exchange rate (INR 60.73/USD), resulting in an increase in debt of Rs 110 billion.""]"

More importantly, BPCL's gross refining margins (GRM) are higher and more stable compared with those of its PSU peers, indicating better operational structure.The company's recently commissioned Bina refinery is of greater complexity and, therefore, generates higher GRMs. BPCL is also increasing its capacity/complexity levels in its Kochi refinery, and when completed, this should boost its revenue/refining margins significantly.Its chemical project withLGChemicals to manufacture high-value adsorbents is another factor that will increase its profitability in the coming years. One reason that the analysts are showing an increased interest in the company is that it'sinvestmentsin the oil and gas exploration field have started yielding results. As of now, it has a stake in 25 blocks in 16 countries. Among them, the blocks in Mozambique and Brazil, partnering Anadarko andPetrobras, have significant potential.The recent discoveries in its Mozambique and Brazil fields should help the company derisk its business from the volatility of oil marketing. The recent deals suggest that its assets in the Mozambique fields are world-class and in line with the deal; BPCL's 10% stake is estimated to be worth $ 2.5 billion.Even though it is the best player among the PSU oil marketing companies and a good long-term bet, it is not free of the regulatory woes plaguing the sector. For instance, the threat of export parity pricing, which will potentially wipe out the entire profits of oil marketing companies, is still hanging over the sector. Similarly, the proposed one-time price increase to reduce the under-recovery in diesel is off the table, and may not happen till the ongoing assembly elections are complete.Though the monthly diesel price increases of 45 paisa per litre is continuing, there is risk associated with it during the upcoming national elections.

In this tough scenario, whatever acquisitions they have made in the past have started to garner fruitful results. Oil PSUs in India have to battle with bigger and economically stronger Chinese firms in the chase for resources abroad.The public sector units in India were faced with procedures which are really cumbersome and time-consuming. By the time they get the clearance, the deal is already been taken by the competing nations or individual entrepreneurs. However realizing the limited domestic natural resources and importance of availability of raw material are prerequisites not only for the growth of the manufacturing sector alone, but for the economy as a whole, the policy makers in India unveiled a new policy in 2011 which accords greater independence to PSUs in their overseas acquisitions.Of late the government is also mulling setting up a new company, loosely modelled on the concept of a sovereign wealth fund, to finance the acquisition of natural resource assets abroad. The proposed Indian Overseas Investment Corp Ltd (INOIC) will be wholly owned by the government and administered by the Ministry of Finance. INOIC will invest in ownership of natural resource assets overseas. It will be a development finance institution with the mandate to provide equity and debt to public sector companies to secure natural resources abroad.Heavy weight PSUs such as ONGC, BPCL, coal India and NTPC have ventured into the foreign assets acquisitions in a significant manner in the last few years. ONGC Videsh Limited (OVL), a wholly owned subsidiary of ONGC, has stake in 32 oil and gas projects in 16 countries such as Vietnam, Russia, Sudan, Iran and Brazil.Till January 2013, BPCL has a total of 17 discoveries out of which eight are in Mozambique, six in Brazil and one each in India, Indonesia and Australia. Recently a significant oil discovery has been made in an ultra-deep water block off Brazil where state-owned Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Videocon Industries together hold 40 per cent interest. The discovery has been estimated to hold more than 1 billion barrels of oil. BPCL has also entered into the arena of shale gas in 2010 with acquisition of interest in a block with shale gas potential in the Perth basin in Australia.The recent trend of overseas acquisitions by the cash rich PSUs is likely to gather further momentum in the near future considering the amount of cash available in their books and initiatives taken by the policy makers. Oil giants such as ONGC Videsh Limited (OVL) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) are making speedy pace in overseas soils in their efforts to discover more oil fields to meet nation's growing energy needs. Meanwhile India's second biggest state-owned explorer OIL has already formed an overseas subsidiary to look after its assets abroad.""]"

CRISIL estimates that these companies are well placed to distribute 40 per cent of the corpus (Rs 64,000 crore) as dividend without impacting growth plans.That is Rs 27,000 crore more than the Rs 37,000 crore dividend paid by these companies last fiscal. In proportion to the shareholding, the excess payout to the government could, thus, be Rs 20,000 crore (out of the extra Rs 27,000 crore).Without incorporating the extra dividends (over and above what was paid last year), CRISIL Research expects this year\'s fiscal deficit at 5.2 per cent of the gross domesticproduct(GDP).The Rs 20,000-crore additional income would approximate 20 basis points of the fiscal deficit, which can help the government reach closer to its stated fiscal deficit target of 4.8 per cent.Sandeep Sabharwal, Senior Director, CRISIL Research, said, ""The government will have to cut spending to meet its fiscal deficit goal. But this may not augur well for an economy that has slowed down and fresh spending cuts can also create growth hurdles. Hence, the government could persuade companies with large cash reserves to announce special dividends or a buyback programme.""']"

The entire thesis for oil marketingstockshave done well of late is a strong rupee and a weak crude. Now it is the reverse, rupee is stable and crude is up.Deven Choksey: This kind of phase would continue but to my mind, the oil marketing companies and the upstream oil companies have moved up in the recent times largely.The movement is based on the expectations of the NDA led government coming into power and the systematically working on the subsidy part of the business, which is troubling most of these companies.The companies are not growing and on that assumption, larger amount of money got allotted to some of these oil marketing and the upstream companies. To my mind, that part of the story has not changed at this point of time and probably one will have to wait and see once the government takes the position and takes the policy actions thereafter.Market would have done a run-up little ahead of time. I think that some correction is justified given the kind of rally that they have had. In this correction, you might once again see the long-only funds contributing to the process and add into the portfolio of some of these companies.So I would rather remain opportunistic to buy in this particular scenario in a falling market or corrective market in some of the companies likeBPCLorONGCandGAIL.ET Now: Reliance is coming out with its earnings over the long weekend what is it that you are expecting this time?Deven Choksey: In case of Reliance, the earnings estimates are likely to be more on the positive side. Also from the fact that last quarter you are likely to see the contribution of Shale gas getting reported and more importantly in the retail space the company has already started making profits.So these two portfolios are likely to contribute smartly to the bottom line of the earnings of the company. All along we have also been seeing the traction on the distillation side in the refining business and that is where you are likely to see the higher amount of refining margin in this particular quarter.So all in all put together the company would end up with the year somewhere around 67 to 68 to earnings per share as we calculate in this particular times.May be we will have to wait and see as to how exactly they give the commentary pertaining to the petrochemical segment of the business, which is likely to start some of its capacities in financial year 2014-2015 in the second half and that is the trigger because that is where the company would probably start recording the volume led margin growth in the petrochemical segment.So overall it is more of a commentary as far as the future or the 2014-2015 financial year is concerned, most of it is priced in though as I would call it but growth would be seen largely from the Shale gas. So these are the few areas which one would like to look at in case of Reliance's results.ET Now: Do you likeJubilant Foodworksafter the recent correction that the stock has gone through and of course now that the FII limit being hiked does it seem like in the near term it may have bottomed out?Deven Choksey: I really do not know whether in the near term it has bottomed out at this point of time but what I am more concerned about is the kind of a growth that this company is likely to achieve.To my mind they are facing the headwinds on the growth side and probably that is where the company is on a some amount of a corrective downside as far as the price is concerned. Till the point of time, we see the growth returning back with some better strategies from their side I do not think that people would be in very much hurry to buy into this company.Of course increase in the FII limit wouldmeanthat some amount of allocation of fund would start ending up into this particular stock and that could stabilise the price but to really get thepremiumprices, which they use to command earlier.I do not know whether that could come easily till the time they bring the growth back into the business so really watch the growth coming out and that is where one could allot money into this company.""]"

What are you advising clients to do currently?Rahul Shah:We believe that the steam is still there and the rally is going to continue. Cement is one of the sectors that we have been very bullish on. So stocks like, sayACC, and Ambuja in the large cap space andJK Lakshmiand Dalmia Bharat in the midcap space are names that one can look at. Cement looks very convincing going forward.So cement remains the top bet as of now as a sector and in the month of June, for a trading bet also, cement is one of the top picks. Secondly, given the way the PSU banks have corrected from their recent highs, we believe that there is a lot of money to be made in selective PSU banks.Canara BankandBank of Indiaare two of the top bets. So PSU banks will continue to be the outperformers in this kind of a rally.ET Now: If you are playing the June series, what is it from the cement pack that you would look to trade and what is a one year investment idea?Rahul Shah:I would like to have Ambuja and ACC as my trading bets and in terms of investments, I would get into the midcap space, because there is a huge valuation gap between the large cap and the midcap spaces.Therefore, Dalmia Bharat and JK Cement would be the midcap bets from an investment perspective and I will look at both these stocks in terms of an F&O; or trading perspective in the month of June.ET Now: What about the auto basket? A lot of experts have been betting on the likes of M&M; andTata Motors. Is there anything from the auto ancillary space also that you like?Rahul Shah:We believe that the two wheeler space would do much better going forward. TVS Motors is the top bet in the two wheeler space. In the four wheelers space we still believe that Maruti will continue to do well going forward. So Maruti remains our top bet in the four wheeler space.ET Now: The government may deregulate diesel prices in the next four months and that is going to bode well for the OMCs. Do you like anything from that space?Rahul Shah:We have continued to be bullish on the oil and gas pack for quite some time and among the OMCs,BPCLandHPCLhave been our top bets. Also, the results of both HPCL and BPCL were in line with the Street's expectations.Hence both the stocks should continue to do well. We also continue to likeONGCfrom the current levels. So, all these three remain our top ideas.ET Now: Do you like any of the defensive stocks?Rahul Shah:The market still believes that cyclicals and highbetastocks like infra, cement, metals or banks will continue to move up. So currently we would avoid any of the defensive plays in our portfolio.ET Now: The last time you had mentioned a couple of pharma names -- Reddy's and Divi's.

But with finance minister Arun Jaitley announcing a cut in central excise duty on branded petrol to Rs 2.35 for every litre from Rs 7.50 a litre, such fuel would now be just about Rs 3 per litre costlier than regular petrol.""Demand will definitely go up and we are making aggressive plans to relaunch some of our products and expand sales network,"" Pramod Sharma, executive director at BPCL, told ET.Indian Oil Corporation, too, said it plans to offer XtraPremium petrol on more outlets and may consider re-launching XtraMile branded diesel which it had stopped selling. At present, the country\'s largest oil marketing company sells XtraPremium in only 600 outlets in the country, down from a peak of over 4,000 in 2007-08, when premium petrol was priced just about Re 1 more than regular petrol.""We will be targeting owners of new-generation two-wheeler segment and new-generation premium cars,"" IOC said in an email response to ET\'s query.The companies plan to roll out new marketing campaigns for their branded fuels over the next couple of months. ""We are looking at localised campaigns to begin with so that we convert regular fuel users into branded fuel users,"" said a senior executive at HPCL, which sells premium petrol under the brand PoWer.While the oil marketing companies may ultimately hire advertising agencies for marketing campaigns, they may start with campaigns created internally because government companies have to follow certain procedures for selecting agencies and that may take time, said a senior executive of an oil marketing company.Branded fuel offers better margins to oil marketers as well as dealers and petrol pump owners. The OMCs, which buy, refine and market fuel, add additives to the fuel and can sell the product at higher profit margin for the value addition.Ravi Shinde, president of Petrol Dealers Association, Mumbai, said it\'s a win-win situation for oil marketers, dealers and consumers.""OMCs spend 75 paise-Rs 1 per litre on additives and can get very good profit margin. We too get better margin than unbranded fuel and of course the consumer gets more option,"" he said.Shinde expects demand for branded fuel to soar with prices falling. ""Branded fuel doesn\'t increase mileage, but has a detergent like quality that keeps the machine clean internally and the maintenance cost stays low,"" he said.The rising number of premium vehicles on Indian roads can also boost demand for branded fuel as owners of such machines are keen to take good care of their vehicles.While overall passenger vehicle sales in the country declined 6.05% in 2013-14 to 2.5 million units, sales of luxury cars grew 6%-8% to about 35,000 units.

Excerpts:ET Now: Talking about Crompton, it is a very positive news, but the stock is not buying that probably because of the pressure today on infra/cap goods, maybe BHEL numbers, GVK numbers, all are very-very dismal.Hemang Jani:Absolutely. This entire space had a lot of optimism once we had the new government and there was expectation built up about the policy action and reforms, but the quarterly numbers that some of these companies have reported, particularly companies like BHEL, L&T; and even some of these smaller companies like Engineers India, have not gone down too well.What is more important is that the kind of noise that you hear from the management. The body language is also not aspiring that kind of confidence. So, we are seeing some kind of a cool off on that space and we think that the market also needed a reason to correct itself because we had seen the run up quite a bit. We have been the best performing markets internationally.Probably flows also reflect the fact that the last three to four days have taken a pause. At the index level we are not seeing too much of a pain but in the broader markets, we are seeing some corrections which probably will go on for a few more days.ET Now: What is the call coming in on the PSU space? At one time everyone was pretty upbeat, but when you read into the numbers of EIL etc., it is not very heartening.Hemang Jani:The PSU pack also had a lot of expectations in terms of more autonomy, policy-related issues being resolved etc. But we are yet to hear anything concrete on that front and in the meantime, the numbers have not been that great.The market is reacting to that. Also, remember the fact that there is a big divestment pipeline which is being lined up, almost about 63000 crore. So, some of these names wherever the divestment is likely to happen, there is some kind of a cap at least for the time being.ET Now: What do you do with the PSU banks? Valuations may be cheap but can they get substantially cheaper? We are revisiting that argument again.Hemang Jani:Some of the banks have not reported that impressive set of numbers. In State Bank of India, the slippages were on a higher side and the fact that some of the companies where there have been negative news flow, the kind of exposure that they have is definitely not going down too well with the markets.So, we think that for now, there could be a bit of pause in this space. Going forward, if we have some kind of a revival and particularly the loan growth, once that starts picking up to about 15-16%, then there is going to be some kind of an interest.Also, we are hearing that in case of SBI, there is a big QIP or some kind of a placement which is being talked about. So that could also affect the market price in the short run.ET Now: How are you looking at the oil and gas space because earlier, there were announcements that the decision on the gas pricing will come by the end of September. A lot of clarity is required in this space and that is going to be the big game changer. What is the view?']"

Losses they incur are made good through cash subsidy from the government and subsidy sharing by oil exploration companies such as ONGC and OIL, ET said in a report.India\'s FY15 fuel subsidy is estimated at Rs 1 trn (USD16.6bn) as per Deutsche Bank\'s Brent oil price forecast of USD111/bbl. We estimate that every USD10/bbl fall in oil price reduces India\'s annualized oil import bill by USD 10 bn and fuel subsidy by USD 5.6 bn.As per a Deutsche Bank report, state-owned oil companies are likely to be the key beneficiaries of lower oil price. ONGC and Oil India will benefit of falling fuel subsidy as they expect them to fund about 65 per cent of the fuel subsidies.The oil marketing companies such as HPCL, BPCL and IOC will benefit from lower working capital. ONGC, BPCL and HPCL are part of Deutsche Bank\'s top picks.In a separate report, Moody\'s anticipates a full deregulation of diesel prices over the next few months as it expects the newly-elected government will continue to support the Rs 0.4-0.5 per litre price hike that has been in place since early 2013.According to analysts, if the rupee stays stable, diesel price deregulation would be just two or three months away. Currently, diesel under-recoveries have fallen to less than Rs 1/litre from Rs 4.4/litre in May 2014.Goldman Sachs estimates losses on retail diesel sales are now down to Rs0.8/ltr from Rs1.3/ltr in the first fortnight of Aug 2014 and Rs2.5/ltr in the second fortnight of July 2014, and will fall to Rs0.3/ltr after the price hike on 1 Sep 2014, assuming oil prices and diesel cracks remain around current levels.This implies we could effectively be done with the monthly cycle of diesel price increases in the next two months and diesel will be market-priced, added the Goldman report.Goldman believes that benefits to state-owned upstream will accrue slowly as the government reduces its subsidy and natural gas price hikes on current volumes could be lower than consensus expectations.It sees greatest upside for HPCL and BPCL with improving marketing margins.

We don\'t see any brand synergy in doing so and also we have enough capabilities to invest more in retail expansion,"" BPCL chairman and managing director S Varadarajan told reporters here over the weekend after the AGM.The chairman said BPCL had opened more than 900 outlets last fiscal, taking the company\'s total retail network to over 12,500, the company will open more outlets, but did not specify a number.It can be noted that private players like Reliance and Essar Oil with thousands of outlets have shut down marketing following the government refusal to free diesel prices after the 2006 oil spike. But with diesel being sold at market price now, they are likely to re-enter marketing now.HPCLchairman and managing director Nishi Vasudeva had earlier this month said her company would like to tie-up with private players for convenience and to save on capital expenditure, but added nothing had been finalised yet.Currently, oil firms are selling diesel at 35 paise above market rate as the government has not allowed them officially to cut prices. There have been reports that it may formally announce diesel deregulation post-October 15 assembly elections.Diesel prices have been brought to market levels following the staggered deregulation that began in September 2012. Under this, OMCs were allowed to raise retail prices by 50 paise per month and also due to falling crude prices, which is hovering around USD 98 a barrel now.Meanwhile, Varadarajan said BPCL will invest over Rs 12,000 crore over the next four years in the Mozambique and Brazil upstream business. This is nearly double of what the state-run company had spent in exploration and production in the past decade.The investments will be part of the Rs 45,000-crore capex planned, including expansion of Kochi refinery from 9.5 mt to 15.5 mt at the cost of Rs 16,500 crore, over the next three years.The Mozambique (gas) and Brazil (oil) fields will start production by FY18 and FY19 respectively, Varadarajan said, adding that so far no domestic player has contacted the company for gas or oil, Varadarajan said.BPCL\'s exploration subsidiary Bharat PetroResources (BPRL), owns oil and gas assets in Brazil, Mozambique, Indonesia and Australia, and owns a 20 per cent stake in the Brazil blocks via an equal joint venture with Videocon Industries;Petrobras SAwhich holds 60 per cent.In Mozambique, BPCL holds a 10 per cent stake in the gas blocks operated by the US-basedAnadarko PetroleumCorp. Mozambique blocks have around 50-70 trillion cubic feet natural gas, which is nearly 10 times the reserves of RIL\'s D6 block in the Krishna-Godavari basin. Out of this BPCL\'s share is at 5-7 tcf.Varadarajan also said BPCL will be booking 1-3 mn tonnes LNG annually as part of its plans to improve its gas business through its East and West coasts terminals.""We are looking at booking capacities in LNG terminals. For our international business, we are looking for long term gas and have signed up two million tonnes import gas pact with foreign players,"" Varadarajan said.He further said the company will be laying the country\'s first cross-country pipeline that will connect to Bangladesh. Its subsidiary Assam-based Numaligarh Refineries will shortly begin work on laying the 170-km pipeline from Siliguri in Bengal to Parbatipur in Bangladesh.The pipeline will help BPCL penetrate the Bangladeshi market and ensure sustained supply of oil products to Bangladesh.']"

Excerpts:ET Now: Since you are the man who does all the number crunching, what is your own assessment of what it means for ONGC?Nitin Tiwari: Earning impact is immediate for ONGC and it is a positive for the company. ONGC has made the investment environment very positive given that it's about to come up with an FPO. So, the next number that investors should be watching out for is basically crude oil realisations.The government has said that ultra deep water and difficult fields would invite a premium. Although how that premium would be calculated is still not defined, but at least one can be contain that the prices could be higher for those discoveries and this would add to the top line and as well as the bottom line of ONGC immediately.If going forward the government reduces the subsidy burden on ONGC and its crude oil realisation also improves, which we do expect is going to happen, then that would be earning accretive for ONGC. We expect that the earnings in FY16 and FY17 could be significantly better than in FY14.ET Now: You have mentioned about ONGC and Reliance. What about the oil marketing companies? The belief is that competition would increase. Therefore, it is not all hunky-dory. Would you go ahead and give a buy recommendation on any of the OMC stocks though?Nitin Tiwari: In the past years what has happened is that the under recovery, that is incurred by oil marketing companies, gets subsidised by either cash payment from the government or basically discounts in crude oil sales from upstream companies.Cash payment, which comes from the government, comes with a delay because of which oil marketing companies tend to take loans from the market and incur interest cost on that. With deregulation of diesel, their sales would be monetise immediately and their loan requirement would go down for working capital which will reduce their interest cost. These reductions in interest cost would improve their balance sheets and also their earnings would get a rerating of their trading multiples.What lies ahead is a rerating for trading multiples for HPCL, BPCL and IOCL. HPCL is discounted in terms of valuations, but BPCL has already moved quite a lot. I believe that HPCL is still left behind and there is a catch up which can happen.Oil marketing companies operate close to about 50,000-55,000 retail outlets across the country and they also operate product pipelines throughout the country, which is a significant asset. So, it is not that easy for any private player to immediately come and replicate this asset.Although the private competition will be there, there will be a ramp up in terms of retail sales from Reliance and Essar.""]"

Excerpts:ET Now: What do you make ofFriday'sclose? Do you think the grand finale is in place orFriday'sprice action certainly paves way for another 200-300-point rally for theNifty?Sahil Kapoor:Friday'sclose is quite significant and it is a very strong close. Generally if you look at historical correlations, a strongerFridayin general leads to a stronger opening on Mondays.ET Now: Let's get back on the OMC discussion. Where do you see stocks like HP, BP andIOChead from the current levels considering the kind of breakout rally they have had inFriday'ssession?Sahil Kapoor: Specifically,HPCLis a chart which stands out. Largely, we are seeing a breakout which is a breakout of about 10 years. It had a high of about 550 three-four times in 2004-2008-2009 and now it has broken out of those highs. So, the rally will be a bigger one compared to what we have seen up until now.Targets of 750-770 in the medium term cannot be ruled out on HPCL, but having said that, this rally has been led byBPCLin terms of percentage. If you were to do a comparison, this year BPCL is one of the best performing stocks in the Nifty. Up untilThursday'ssession, it was up about 106% during the year. So again, these two stocks are going to be the standout performers and the rally will be much stronger compared to what we have seen up until now.ET Now: Within the financial space minus PSU banks, what do you like the most?Sahil Kapoor: Largely, we have been quite bullish onBank Niftyfor the last two-three months, but now, it is approaching an area where it has begun to look a little overbought and that overbought position is in the private banking space and PSU banks per se may outperform them.For performance in banking, you would have to look at PSU banks and right now, the space that you should look at is large caps. PNB and BOB are the two stocks which have excellent charts. PNB per se has given an excellent breakout the day before yesterday and yesterday's expiry again had very strong volumes and a breakout. So I expect PNB to have another 8% to 10% rise from the current levels and on the second stock, I would prefer to buyBank of Baroda. Again, I see another 8% to 10% rally.ET Now: Coming on tyre and some paint companies, they were also on tearon Friday. If crude is down, operating profit margins for both these groups will certainly go up.Sahil Kapoor: Largely if you look at most of the paint stocks, the chart which was clearly a breakout story was Asian Paints. At 690-688, it had an excellent place to go higher. We are right now seeing a very similar chart pattern in AkzoNobel, which is a cash counter, but the rally can be very swift in that and most of these counters will continue to see a very strong momentum because the inter-market correlations have set in their favour and the same benefit could actually go to some tyre companies as well.You will have similar chart patterns in the tyre space also. For example, Ceat. I would be focussed more on these companies in the midcap space which have much more room to run. Today's rally and yesterday's rally was largely a large cap phenomena and the midcap space is still to catch up. So you will have rallies in the space in the coming few days.ET Now: The oil cool-off has also benefited the aviation plays, the likes of SpiceJet, Jet Airways. Do you think this is a knee-jerk reaction or is there a trade in these names?Sahil Kapoor: Largely in the aviation space, I see that the reaction will be a little muted compared to the earlier spaces that we have talked about because in these stocks, the momentum and volumes indicators are not as significantly favouring these stocks. So you may have some bounce backs and a rally which will be short-lived, but a larger trade mostly will not be present in this space. So I would not recommend any medium term play in the aviation space for the trading bet on the oil crash.ET Now: I want to talk about the secret Santa picks. I know it is a little early, but just want to talk about what the top ideas are from the metals space that you may have.Sahil Kapoor: Historically what we have seen is that theBSEmetal index has a very clear run in the month of December. If you were to look at the seasonal data in the last 10 years, only 2011 was an off year where the metal index was down and we feel that there is an opportunity where in the month of December, you will be able to see a strong rally in all the metal stocks and we have singled out about three stocks, which areTata Steel, Sesa Sterlite and JSW Steel.We feel that a rally of about 7.5% to 8% could materialise in the BSE metal space and these stocks can outperform the BSE metal index. It will be largely driven by the domestic rally as well as international cues. If you could plot a ratio of the metal index with US long term bonds, you will clearly see a very strong area of support and if the hypothesis of this rally is being cyclical in nature, it should favour cyclicals to a very large extent and this is the space where you have a sweet trade in the offering. So I expect these stocks to move 10% from the current levels and reach higher levels in the month of December.""]"

Circumventing the issues pertaining to the earlier DBTL scheme, the present scheme provides the comfort of using either Aadhaar or bank account number to get enrolled. Forms and procedures have been simplified, while intensive customer reach activities have been conducted. Out of the 16 crore customers, around 5.2 crore have been enrolled so far.It's a massive campaign that has to be executed in short a time.There are other countries which transfer subsidies electronically to the recipients, but no other country has attempted implementing it at such a large scale in such short time. Beginning with 54 districts on November 15, we aim to cover the entire country by end March 2015. From April 1, 2015, all the LPG cylinders in the country will be sold at market rate and subsidy to eligible customers will reach their bank accounts directly. Technology is playing a key role in making this possible. A lot of co-ordination has been achieved at the local level among banks, state machinery, LPG distributorships andUIDAIfor this scheme. Similarly, we have deployed innovative methods to reach the consumers and cause them minimum inconvenience in getting cash-transfer compliant.How are you ensuring that all the customers are reached in time to complete the formalities?Mobile vans equipped with computer, internet connection, printer and scanner have already been deployed in the states ofTamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh to facilitate completion of modalities at the customer's doorstep. Camps have also been arranged at various places in every state to collect Aadhaar and bank forms from consumers and facilitate obtaining Aadhar cards or open bank accounts. All distributorships are kept open on their weekly off, specifically for collecting Aadhaarbank forms. SMSes are being sent twice a week in regional languages and calling up consumers by distributors is an ongoing activity. A massive nation-wide publicity campaign is being launched from January 1 with a few celebrities to increase the awareness about the scheme. At BPCL, we have appointed Districts Guardians to supervise the activities for every district whereBPCLis the OMC coordinator. All these efforts are being reviewed fortnightly by director (marketing) and myself. The scheme is being monitored by PMO, the Hon'ble MOS and his team in addition to the chairman and MDs and director (marketing) of the OMCs.How will the benefits play out?I think this scheme will be a game changer in terms of petroleum subsidies. There will be total transparency on where the subsidy is going. Genuine customers will receive the subsidy, while public money will be saved which can be used for nation building. Once all the cylinders are available at market price, there won't be any incentive to divert subsidised cylinders. Exactly how much, that is difficult to say, but our last attempt to remove duplicate LPG connections showed a 10% reduction.""]"

The biodiesel will have to be delivered at multiple locations across the country from August through March 2016. The technical and price bids are to be submitted online by August 19.The maiden purchase will help retailers discover the price of biodiesel, produced from vegetable oil or animal fat, and get ready for the blending when it becomes mandatory, anoil industry executivesaid.The National Policy on Biofuels had proposed a 20 per cent blending ratio for both biodiesel and ethanol by 2017. So far the government has made it mandatory only to blend 5 per cent ethanol, produced mainly from sugar and corn, with petrol. An uncertainty with regard to the availability of biodiesel has also slowed the progress towards making it mandatory for blending.In a bid to reduce the use of fossil fuels, which contribute directly to air pollution, the government has been encouraging use of ethanol and biodiesel by fossil fuel retailers.Three months ago, the government had removed a 12.36 per cent excise duty levied on ethanol supplied for blending with petrol and raised the import duty on sugar to 40 per cent from 25 per cent as part of steps to support the local sugar industry.India imports 80 per cent of thecrude oilit consumes and a 5 per cent biodiesel and ethanol substitution can result in substantial savings in foreign exchange. With rising pollution impacting public health and becoming a hotly debated national issue, India has been pushing for cleaner fuel, including increased use of gas for cooking and transportation, and aiming to install record capacity in renewable energy.']"

This is why they are lobbying the government to give them a free hand to fight private competition.""We have had little control over distributors. We have always had the dilemma that if we were to fire a dealer we may lose the market to a competitor and not be able to recover that quickly because the appointment of a replacement would take a long time,"" said the executive.He was referring to the challenges state firms have faced in firing distributors engaged in malpractices, which lower the quality of service to customers. But a flexibility to appoint a new dealer will remove this dilemma, he said.Moreover, the government has mandated a 10% automation every year at IOC, HPCL, and BPCL, which currently have about a third of their regular petrol pumps automated. This technological application helps companies keep a check on adulteration at fuel stations.The proposed system will also help state firms attract most entrepreneurs interested in the petrol pump business, leaving fewer candidates for the likes of Reliance or Shell.

Airlines will have a choice of fuel suppliers, which should spur competition and result in better prices and services.""This will be a common infrastructure available to all for a charge. A common infrastructure would also help reduce the cost of fuel at these airports due to the reduction in expenses on maintaining infrastructure by oil companies individually,"" said a senior AAI official on condition of anonymity.The facility is proposed to be set up by a new company, which will be 37.5% owned by Indian Oil and 25% owned by AAI.Bharat Petroleum CorporationandHindustan Petroleum Corporationwill own 18.75% each. Currently, each oil company has its own infrastructure at AAI-operated airports, while private airports such as those in New Delhi and Mumbai have a common facility for supplying fuel. According to some estimates, a shared facility could lower fuel costs by anywhere between 5% and 10%. Analysts do not share the optimism on the benefit of the initiative and want AAI to improve conditions at smaller airports.""The service should be implemented first at smaller airports where access to good quality fuel is still rare and operators continue to face issues in getting fuel to their operational site. One such example is the heliports at Vaishno Devi and in Amarnath, where shockingly, jet fuel is still transported in drums, as it was done during World War II,"" said Mark D Martin, founder & CEO ofMartin Consulting LLC, an aviation consulting firm based in Asia.Fuel accounts for as much as 50% of an airline\'s operational expenses in India. Value added tax on ATF varies in each state and ranges from zero to 30%.

Within years of their launch, private retailers had taken away about 15% share in the profitable diesel market.Which is why state firms are making every move to slow down the march of private retailers as they reopen mothballed outlets and plan to add new ones after the government scrapped subsidy on diesel late last year. Reliance Industries is hoping to reopen all its 1,400 outlets by March 2016 andEssarplanning to double its current count of 1,550 in about a year.The rollout could have been much faster but private firms have been cautious due to a fear that the government subsidy, available only to state companies to cushion consumers facing high oil prices, may snap back if oil prices were to climb again. This is what had shut them out of the market in 2008.A sustained supply glut and a slowdown in some of the energy-guzzling economies are now pushing oil companies in believing oil prices may not go up in a hurry, setting stage for a fierce competition in the fuel retailing business in the country.Sensing this, HPCL, IOC and BPCL are working with the government to bring about a new guideline that would allow them to freely appoint dealers.This means flooding the market with more dealers, enhanced brand presence, and making it difficult for private players to pick dealers or make money. This is also aimed at giving state retailers the handle to raise quality of service as the faltering dealers could be easily suspended without fear of losing market share.?The quality of service is key,? said B Ashok, chairman of IOC, the country?s largest fuel retailer. A higher level of service - check on adulteration, provision of eateries and cleanliness - aided by technology and tighter control on dealers gave private players quick success last time round.To boost customer service, state retailers are investing in dealers and filling stations. ?It?s dealers who do customer solicitation,? Vasudeva said.Dealers of state-run retailers have just received a hike in commission they get on fuel sales. ?With increased competition, dealers should also be able to sustain,? Ashok said. Besides, more than one lakh of total 2.5 lakh attendants at IOC petrol pumps have been trained, he said.IOC has also launched a mobile app, making it easier for customers to locate petrol pumps and know its features such as availability of eatery or a retail store, among other things. A loyalty programme, higher investment in branding, eateries, retail stores and separate toilets for men and women will help attract customers, said Ashok.PRIVATE CHALLENGERSPrivate players too have similar programmes. In some places they are also offering volume discount, trying to make a dent in the established markets. In Gujarat, a BPCL dealer said he is not able to match the volume discount an Essar pump, located barely a few hundred yards away, offers on diesel sales. ?But they can?t sustain it for long. May be six months, or a year, but they will have to fall in line,? he said, not too worried about the short-term losses he might be incurring because of the competition.?There exists several levers like service, quality and quantity assurance, non-fuel retail etc. which we will exert to drive footfalls into our retail outlets,? said a spokesman at Essar, which has hired some public sector veterans, including former HPCL chairman S Roy Choudhury, for the retail venture.For private players, appointing new dealers isn?t easy today due to scarcity of land at attractive locations.']"

The retail sale of biodiesel blended fuel has recently been launched in four cities.With most major cities struggling with polluted air and related health issues, fossil fuel retailers have been mandated by the government to add cleaner biofuels to the petrol and diesel they sell, but their availability and pricing have been a hurdle. An increased consumption of local biofuels can help bring down the import bill for India, which meets 80% of its crude oil requirement through imports.The National Policy on Biofuels had earlier proposed a 20% blending ratio for both biodiesel and ethanol by 2017, but the government has made only 5% ethanol blending binding.']"

Of this, Rs 20,000-25,000 crore will be on upstream business to develop assets inMozambiqueand Brazil, Rs 30,000-35,000 crore on refinery expansion. The refinery expansion would be mainly at Bina and also Numaligarh if we get capital subsidy for the latter, essentially to cater to central and north India. We would spend another Rs 10,000 crore on marketing infrastructure and pipelines. We will upgrade our network, retail outlets, coastal terminal for Rs 15,000-20,000 crore.How will the revenue mix change when the upstream business kicks off?The upstream business will start generating revenues by 2020. In another 10 years from now, our upstream revenue would compete with our downstream revenue.The Kochi refinery is seen as a game changer for you. How is it coming up and what are the margin expected from it?We have completed 87 per cent of work at Kochi and will start the commissioning activity by May 2016. At the current rates, the refinery will be making margin of $9 a barrel. There are options to expand and we will look at it. We can transport the output through the coast to eastern India where the demand is huge.What is the expansion plan for Bina refinery? Are you looking at investors for it?We plan to increase the output at Bina from 8 million tonne to 15 million. Bina refinery?s equity structure provides for 49 per cent ownership by us, 26 per cent byOmanand the rest 24 per cent can come through strategic partner, multinational company, or through public issue. Due to the initial losses we have not gone public yet. When the project reaches a substantial size next year, we will induct an investor who would also be a partner for the next phase of expansion.Given the fall in crude prices, would you have to write-off investments made in overseas assets? Would you look at more acquisitions since valuations are cheap?We acquired assets at early exploration stage and there?s no question of writing-off, but fresh investments in these assets will be done after considering the revenue potential. We could make more acquisitions abroad if the price is right. We are evaluating proposals of early exploration stage projects inAfricaand the Americas.Given the steep fall in crude prices, do you anticipate more inventory losses?Reports suggest crude prices would be benign in 2016 between $50-60 a barrel. If it ranges in that band we won?t have too many issues. There would be some correction in our second quarter FY16 results but for the full year there would be recovery.What is the next most exciting thing forBPCL?We want to look beyond fuels by setting up non-fuel retail outlets across our network, especially in rural areas. Our ?In and Out? retail stores have annual revenues of Rs 10,000 crore and we are experimenting with options to roll out a plan in six months. Non-fuel retail revolution is waiting to happen.']"

Now at 40, people are saying, painting a doomsday scenario saying crude could well go down to 20. Assuming that oil stabilises or rises from these levels, is Cairn, which has been beaten down so much, a better bet or would you still prefer the oil marketing companies for fundamental reasons?Sudip Bandyopadhyay:I would not like to compare these two. Let us look at oil marketing companies, they are as you rightly said fundamentally very strong companies, they had a couple of major issues as far as domestic markets are concerned, the entire subsidy issue and the sharing of the same has been a very-very confusing issue for the investors. But to a great extent that is becoming a thing of the past and that gives us a confidence to buy into these stocks.HPCLandBPCLboth are excellent stocks.If somebody has one year plus time horizon, great buys even at current valuation. Your summary on Cairn India also is absolutely correct, it is beaten down significantly and there is value visible at current levels but whether the call should be to buy now or wait a little more time, I am not very sure. Being a little conservative, I will probably hold on.Yes, I am also a little worried about the reports which are coming out from global commodity players, includingGoldman Sachs, which are predicting $20 a barrel oil prices very soon. So it is better to be a little cautious, let oil show the momentum on the upward side, then probably I will get into and buy Cairn India.']"

The project was originally conceived through a joint venture company, BORL but the OCC did not contribute equity beyond the initial Rs 75 crore.The Omanese oil major came back to pick up 26 per cent stake in the project for an additional Rs 1,220 crore.The BORL was formed as an equal joint venture company way back in 1993. However, following inordinate delays in the implementation of the project, OOC froze its investment in the company at Rs 75 crore for a two per cent equity stake.BPCL provided the unbridged portion of the Rs 4,000-crore equity in form of loan. The state-run firm got its loan back once OOC made payments for its 26 per cent share.The remaining 25 per cent is with financial institutions. BPCL also operates a 12 million tonne a year refinery at Mumbai and 9.5 million tonne Kochi unit. It also has majority stakes in the 3 million tonneNumaligarh refineryin Assam.The official said BPCL is expanding and upgrading its Kochi refinery in Kerala to process high sulphur crudes by 2016. Kochi refinery capacity is being raised to 15.5 million tonne from current 9.5 million tonne.Crude grades with a high sulphur content are cheaper, and refineries that have installed speciality secondary units to process them can lower feed costs and increase their margins.Besides boosting margins with the upgrade and expansion, the refinery will also be able to produce fully Euro IV compatible petrol and diesel.Also, Numaligarh refinery capacity is being planned to be raised to 9 million tonne. The expansion, however, is still at the drawing-board stage and it would hinge on tax concessions and other benefits from the central and state governments, he said.']"

Kitchen accidents, which includecylindersblowing up, kill about 4,000 people every year, according to National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data. In the 2001-14 period, the toll from gas cylinders andstovebursting stands at about 53,000 people, some 41,000 of them women.While it\'s difficult to parse the numbers?kerosene stoves are also responsible?theLPGblasts can\'t all be blamed on customer carelessness, according to several people aware of the matter and documents that ET has seen.According to them, some staterun cooking gasbottlingplants are violating safety norms. Safety systems are being tweaked or bypassed to allow defective cylinders to go into homes because of the intense pressure to meet demand.Then there\'s the anecdotal evidence ? anyone who\'s been in an Indian kitchen can vouch for the severely battered state of cylinders at times. But in a market where customers can get desperate, they\'re liable to take anything that\'s on offer.The state-owned suppliers reject any suggestion that safety norms are not being observed.Household consumption of LPG rose 5.7 per cent between April and December 2015, fuelled mainly by new subscribers. The companies have added 1.5 crore subscribers following the government push to scale up access to clean cooking fuel.In the 14 years to 2014, which is the period for which NCRB data is available, the toll from gas cylinders and stoves exploding has never dropped below 3,357 (2004) and has hit a maximum of 4,820 (2010). The toll rose to 3,525 in 2014 from 3,395 in the year before.Sources said safety norms were being violated at plants of all three state-owned fuel suppliers. India Oil Corp. (IOC)Hindustan PetroleumCorp. (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corp. (BPCL) all flatly denied that their bottling plants violated safety norms.However, email correspondence between HPCL headquarters and zonal managers along with plant safety data suggest otherwise. The emails also show the struggle of senior management to get plants to meet standards.""Despite various communications it is observed that thrust is not given to quality of cylinders filled at plants and we have come across some LPG accident at customer premise which can be attributed to plant,"" a senior executive at HPCL headquarters wrote recently in an email to zonal managers. Following a performance review in December, the situation at many plants was ""alarming,"" the executive said in the email.HPCL executives, however, said all systems are in order and that the executives routinely send emails to ensure that there is no violation under any circumstance. But some of the details in the letter seem to indicate that view may be mistaken. ""Electronic Leak Detector (ELD) & O-Ring Detector (OLD) are bypassed/not fully used at many plants despite plant managers being well aware that any cylinder with these defects can cause an accident at customer premise,"" according to the email.These refers to checks that can detect flaws in cylinders.""Also, it is observed that at most of the plants with 100 per cent OLD operation also, O-Ring defect cylinders are very less which indicates less sensitivity is set in OLD, which may allow No Connect-No Leak cylinder to pass,"" the executive said in his email, adding, ""Any misalignment cylinder will pass or a cylinder which is capped for any defect can pass.""HPCL operates 45 LPG bottling plants, almost a fourth of the coletuntry\'s total, and has connected more than two-thirds of its sites with an online monitoring system where regular plant production and safety data can be accessed by headquarters. But some plants don\'t stream data to the portal at times.At most plants, the number of defective cylinders rejected is more than that reported in the management information system (MIS), the executive said in the email.This also reflects ineffective regulation. The Oil Industry Safety Directorate (OISD) and the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO) prescribe safety standards for bottling plants and carry out audits to make sure companies meet those. The audit reports are shared with top company executives as well as oil ministry officials. OISD has no powers to penalize plants but PESO can.']"

With a 46% jump in net profit,BPCLhas, once again, met market expectations in the third quarter of 2015-16. A significant spike in the gross refining margin (GRM) and the resultant 81% year-on-year (y-o-y) increase in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation were the main highlights of its third quarter results.Like otheroil marketing companies(OMCs), BPCL too has been a major beneficiary of the fall in crude oil prices and the resultant fall in underrecoveries in petroleum products. The government has already capped its subsidy burden at Rs 12 per litre for kerosene and Rs 18 per kg for LPG. After realising the success of Aadhaar card-linked direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme in providing the LPG subsidy, the government has started implementing DBT on a pilot basis for giving out kerosene subsidy. That means, if crude oil doesn?t move up significantly from the current level, there won?t be any subsidy burden for OMCs in 2016-17.The domestic oil demand has increased in the recent past due to the fall in prices. The domestic sales volume in the third quarter of 2015-16 went up 8% y-o-y on the back of a strong demand for petrol and diesel. The recent push for the road sector in the Budget should further boost demand for petrol and diesel in the coming years.Unlike other OMCs, BPCL has a significant exposure to overseas oil and gas fields. While the company is doing an appraisal of its assets in Brazil, it?s subsidiary is expected toinvestaround $100 million (over Rs 670 crore) in calendar year 2016 in an oil field in Mozambique in which BPCL has around 10% stake. The current low oil and gas prices should help BPCL?s overseas ventures get fater clearances and at a lower cost. Since the current level at which crude is trading is not sustainable in the long term, prices are expected to recover in the next 2-3 years, by the time these field become operational. However, BPCL will be negatively impacted if crude oil prices remain this low for an extended period.Unlike other OMCs, BPCL is valued using the sum of parts (SOP) valuation method and analysts peg the valuation for its overseas upstream projects at around Rs 200 per share. Since these overseas ventures are yet not operational and thus not making profits, their impact won?t be captured in valuation ratios such as PE. This is one reason why it looks like the stock is quoting at premium valuation compared to its peers.Selection Methodology:We pick the stock that has shown the maximum increase in ?consensus analyst rating? in the past one month.

The field has a proven reserve of 137 million metric tonne, the source said.The field is currently producing 20,000 barrels per day of oil and is expected to touch a peak of 100,000 barrels a day in 2021. ""The acquisition is subject to relevant board, government and regulatory approvals and is expected to close by September 2016,"" Indian Oil Corp said in a statement.Attracting strategic investors will give additional momentum to the development of the field, one of the largest oil and gas condensate fields in East Siberia, Rosneft said.The three state firms also signed preliminary agreements with Rosneft to acquire 23.9 per cent stake in the Vankor field in Russia, the nation?s second largest field by output making for 4 per cent of Russian production. The field is engaged in a peak production of about 440,000 barrels a day.Rosneft has entered into similar agreement with Oil and Natural Gas Corporation to raise the latter?s stake to 26 per cent in the Vankor field from 15 per cent now. If the two deals go through, it would take Indian stake to 49.9 per cent in Vankor.ONGC had purchased 15 per cent stake in Vankor last year for $1.27 billion.

Indian Oil,Hindustan Petroleumand Bharat Petroleum ? could see another round of price-earnings (PE) multiples re-rating as historical baggage such as the extent of the burden of oil subsidies and fluctuations in marketing margins that lead toearningsvolatility are gradually diminishing.The three state-run companies are trading 30-50% cheaper than the regional average. As the headwinds for the earnings are evaporating and deregulation sustains in the face of increasing crude prices, PE multiples could expand and the valuation gap with peers narrow. With five states going for elections in the next two months, investors expect OMCs to have limited ability to revise prices in tandem with the increase in crude oil prices.This will impact their marketing margins, or the amount they get over the cost incurred to produce final petroleum products. Analysts consider Rs 1.5 per litre as a fair marketing margin for petrol and diesel. However, the OMCs increased prices by Rs 3.1 and Rs 1.9 per litre on petrol and diesel, respectively in the past week, in line with the increase in the international crude prices.This will assuage investors? concern that these companies may refrain from revising prices due to political compulsions. After the price revision, the average marketing margins will be about Rs 2 on diesel and Rs 2.2 on petrol in the fourth quarter FY16 compared to Rs 1.4 and Rs 2, respectively in the preceding quarter, according to analysts? estimates. The earnings from the marketing division contribute 30-65% of the total operating profits of OMCs.Any dip below the fair marketing margins leads to a sizeable cut in the profits. The government and the OMCs have built buffer to lowersubsidyburden in case crude prices flare up. This has raised hopes that these companies may not have to bear oil subsidy burden in the current and the next fiscal. In the Budget, the government has considered incrementalexcise dutygain of Rs 34,500 crore.However, calculated on the basis of exit rate of excise collection in FY16, the government could have garnered an additional Rs 80,000 crore. This implies that the government may consider cutting excise duty if crude prices continue to rise. Similarly, the OMCs have built a buffer of nearly Rs 8,500 crore on selling liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as actual under-recoveries per cylinder were less than subsidy received from the government.This will help lower subsidy burden in case the government passes on some subsidy burden and protect additional under-recoveries till crude oil prices reach $52 per barrel. Besides, Q4 earnings of these companies are likely to improve as inventory losses in the preceding quarter are likely to reverse.The stocks are trading at 5.5-7.3 times their projected earnings growth against the regional average of 10 times. As the overhang of earnings uncertainties fades, the gap between the local companies and their regional peers may narrow.']"

An expansion underway at Kochi refinery will take about 40% of the BPCL?s planned capex for 2016-17. The refinery is adding 6 million tonne per annum (MTPA) to the existing capacity of 9.5 MTPA. BPCL?s total capacity is about 27.5 million tonne.Another Rs 1,000 crore would go towards upgrading other refineries to help them produce higher grade fuels that meet Euro IV and VI emission norms. The government wants all state refiners to make available Euro IV fuels across the country next year and Euro VI by 2020.About Rs 1,000 crore would be utilised by the company?s upstream business managed by Bharat Petroresources that has just bought nearly 10% stake in an east Siberian field owned by Rosneft. The balance funds would be deployed in building a petrochemicals unit, pipelines, marketing terminals and depots, and procuring cooking gas cylinders.BPCL wouldn?t need to raise fresh funds and would rely on internal resources and the previously-tied up borrowings to finance the planned capex, Balasubramanian said. BPCL and other state firms are now facing tough competition from the private sector in the key fuel retailing business and need to invest more to strengthen their position in the market.?The biggest challenge is to retain and grow themarket sharewith growing competition, and meeting customer expectation in the industry,? he said. In a year after the deregulation of diesel sales,Reliance Industries, Essar Oil and Shell have together taken about 4% in petrol and diesel volumes across the country and threaten to gobble more quickly with their price discounts and other promotional efforts.An ambitious target set by the government to add about 10 crore cooking gas consumers in three years, or about 60% of the current base, means distributors like BPCL will have to invest heavily in setting up import and distribution terminals and bottling plants as well as in purchasing more gas cylinders.']"

Edited excerptsETNow: BPCL's gross refining margins (GRMs) were strong and in terms of operational efficiencies, you have delivered another strong quarter. So walk us through the key highlights both on the GRM front and on the operational front.P Balasubramanian:Overall, the GRMs for the year has been excellent and that is one of the reasons why we had given excellent results. We have our annual GRM for the year at is around 6.59, that is almost $3 more than last year's. So that has been one of the highlights of this year's performance. The second one is that in the marketing side, we have increased our sales and have actually sold almost two million tonnes more than what we did last year. So these are the two main things which are the key drivers for our profits during the current year. Of course, it is supplemented with no underrecovery compensation to be shared by the OMCs. So 100 per cent compensation has been received. So better working capital management, along with these things, have given us the impetus to have excellent performance during the current year.ET Now: Is there any inventory gain though?P Balasubramanian: This year, there was an inventory loss and there were no inventory gains in the current year because crude has moved down further during the current year.ET Now: How much of the strength has come in because of the good refining margins and how much due to the marketing margins if you could give me a breakup of that?P Balasubramanian: Normally, the refining and marketing margins used to be around 50-50 range. This year, because of the excellent performance of the refineries, the refinery margins have been almost around 65 per cent of the total revenue.ET Now: Your volumes have been very robust as well this quarter. Almost 6.2MThigher both on year on year on basis as well as on a sequential basis. How much growth are you witnessing in each of your products? If you could give me highlights, which one would you say is the fastest growing one for you?P Balasubramanian: See the fastest growing product this year has been the petrol which has grown almost around 12.3 per cent in the current year. Overall, the industry growth of petrol is very high in the current year. Of course, it is supplemented by the diesel price increase also. So both put together, has given us good growth in the current year. Actually after a lot of years of stagnating growth in the petroleum sector, this year has seen an excellent growth. So that has really helped sector to do very well.ET Now: Let us talk about the current scenario and crude is at $50 once again. So at $50 per barrel, are you making money in your marketingbusiness?P Balasubramanian:Of course, we are making money at marketing business. Marketing margins are still continue to be around Rs 1800 and diesel is around Rs 1500 per KL. So that continues and on the refining side, the margins were slightly lower compared to Q4 because the crack price of diesel has come down a little. But, of course, it is picking up and it is a matter of early days for the margins to settle but yes, overall the margins have been good both at the refining and marketing level.ET Now: Would you say that GRMs are plateauing or peaking at all?P Balasubramanian: No the growth of diesel in the last couple of fortnights have been very good. The overall demand in the Asian side is very good as far as diesel is concerned. So I think the cracks of diesel will be somewhere around $10 plus for the year as an average. But yes, it is early days yet. We have to wait and watch where the cracks settle at the end of the period.ET Now: Can you give me a sense of your projected cash flow for FY17 because for the longest time, BPCL has not been in expansion mode because the sector was not deregulated. Now the sector is deregulated, you are making money, what would be your projected cash flow?P Balasubramanian: In BPCL, as a company, we have been having excellent capex programme for the last three years. We are expanding. We have commissioned our refinery atMumbaiand the woork on the Kochi refinery is on track. We have spent almost Rs 10,000 crore in 2014-15, more than Rs 10,000 crore in the current year that is 2015-16 and we have capex plan of around Rs 12,000-15,000 crore next year (2016-17) depending upon how the projects come. Of course, major portion of the next year's expenditure will be on our completion of the refinery at Kochi.ET Now: What will be your total refining capacity by end of FY18?P Balasubramanian:It will be around 40 million tonnes.ET Now: And you think the capacity utilisation will be 100 per cent right from inception?P Balasubramanian:Indiais growingmarket. Even if we grow at 5 per cent per annum, we require eight million tonne refining capacity every year. Of course, India is long on refining and we have some extra capacities in case of private refiners but having said that, even that capacity can be absorbed if the growth momentum continues to be around 5 per cent plus in the next three, four years and again we have had to make investments on the refining side again.ET Now: I want a number from you this quarter. You have done 6.3 on GRMs but from here on in the near term, what range do you see your margins coming in at? Can they dip slightly in the near term or do you think you will always be able to beat the 6.3 mark?P Balasubramanian: Last year has been an exceptional year for the refiners. The refinery margins have been excellent last year. We hope that the current year will also give us a decent margin ranging between $4 and $6. Currently the margins are almost roughly around $5 per barrel. But we have to wait and watch how the whole thing spans out because this is a global demand and supply scenario and not only on the domestic market side.ET Now: Recently there were reports that ENI may be selling stake to Exxon in the Mozambique block. You also have a stake there. So do you see possibility of any merger or acquisition there and if yes the valuation of your stake will also go up. Is that not the case?P Balasubramanian:ENI'snewsthat has come is on the Area-4 block. We are in Area-1. Definitely any new price discovery happening in those places will have an impact or will have addition, accretion to our assets value which has been kept very low because of the low oil prices. But it is too early days and nobody has confirmed the news yet.ET Now: What would you say is the total enterprise value of your global business? I know you have got very rich blocks and some of the blocks will start yielding returns in the next two or three years. So if you have to peg a value to your global business, what is the internal number?P Balasubramanian:I do not want to put a number. The Mozambique numbers are known. As we have got the news, Brazil is concerned. They are in the appraisal stage at this point in time. The reserves in place as well as the recoverable reserves of such blocks will be known only by late this year or early next year because appraisal programme has to be done based upon which we have to submit the necessary data to the government of Brazil for the developmental plans. So I am not able to assign a number at this point in time.ET Now: Your investment in global E&P; activity, will that be considered just as an investment where you have invested at the right time? If you get a good buyer, would you like to monetise on your assets or are you eventually in the long term interested in being an operator and running those assets?P Balasubramanian: From the beginning when we entered the upstream side, we have always been an active non-operator. That is the role that we have taken, by which I mean we have our own internal teams which apprise as such, which can discuss with other operators how the development plans and the exploration plans can be devised. So we are very active in this scheme though we are not operators in most of the blocks.Having said that, we are operators in two of the blocks in India, one as a joint operator in the Rajasthan Basin and another in the Cambay Basin where we are the operators. So we have our aspirations to become operators in the long run. But however, our entry to upstream is sort of a risk mitigation and partially to have some sort of control on oil as that is where our investments are.So we are long-term players as far as the upstream is concerned. We do not have any plans to hive off any assets at this point in time but upstream is a business where we have to see that once you have a sizableportfolioof assets, we have to see how to shuffle and reshuffle it but that is still a long way because we are yet to have any income earning assets in our books as of date.""]"

However, BPCL's overseas assets may get a shot in the arm ifExxonMobilacquires 25% stake in the Mozambique field from ENI, an Italian hydrocarbon major, for an estimated $3 billion. If this deal goes through, it will set a new valuation benchmark for the Mozambique assets in a low energy priceenvironment.The Mozambique field has two areas. Area 1 is the field in which BPCL holds 10%, operator for which is Anadarko, and Area 4 is operated by ENI.Analysts have been valuing the Mozambique gas asset stake of BPCL in the range of $5-11 billion, but based on ExxonMobil's offer for a 25% stake in Area 4, the implied value (of Areas 1 & 4) is estimated at $24 billion. This leaves enough room for an upward revision of the stock for the value of BPCL's gas assets.The BPCL's stake was valued in the range of Rs 35-65 per share by the analysts before the ExxonMobil's stake purchase plans. This is likely to go up Rs 200-225 per share based on the new valuation benchmark.At current price, however, the stock valuation does not appear to be at par with this stake. In addition, if crude continues to move up, it will further support BPCL's gas asset valuation, as most of the gas contracts are linked to crude oil prices.If Exxon buys up to 25% stake in ENI, it will try to find a way to buy into the field in which BPCL holds a stake, said a note by Citi. It may seek to synergise across the whole resource base, and this could likely result in a simplified operating structure.""]"

But,Bharat Petroleum Corporation(BPCL) has been able to avert these issues through efficient cost management.As a result, the country's second largest oil marketing company has improved the core return on equity (RoE), which excludes the impact of under recoveries on petroleum products, compared with peers. In FY12, BPCL's core RoE matched that of its peersIndian Oil(IOC), andHindustan Petroleum Corporation(HPCL). In FY16, it was 40% higher than the industry average. In the past two fiscal years, the company's core RoE was 25.3% and 28.8%, respectively.BPCL's refining profits have increased by four times in the past four fiscal years. The proportion of profit from refining in the total operating profit rose to 60% from 50%, during the period.The company's gross refining margin (GRM) improved as freight cost reduced by single point mooring (SPM) at Kochi refinery and higher distillate yield ? proportion ofcrude oilthat is converted into fuel. In addition, BPCL has refineries located near coastal areas ? at Mumbai and Kochi ? with installed refining capacity of 9.5 million metric tonnes (MMT) and 12 MMT, respectively. This reduces the need to hold higher inventory of crude oil. Companies such as IOC, which have inland refineries are required to invest in raw material inventories, which increases working capital requirement.The Kochi refinery capacity will be ramped up to 15.5 MMT by September 2016. Due to this, GRM is expected to increase by $1.5-2 per barrel by the end of the fiscal. Every $1/bbl increase in GRM lifts the earnings growth by 12.5% for BPCL. The incremental earnings from expanded capacity will be an important factor this fiscal and next. This will offset wariness among the investors who believe earnings growth has peaked in FY16.On the marketing front, BPCL's throughput per outlet is 15% higher than peers. As a result, its sensitivity to subsidy burden and fluctuating marketing margin is lower. According to analysts, every Rs0.1/litre increase in the marketing margin will improve earnings per share of FY17 by 3.4%. AtCMPof Rs1,024, BPCL is valued at 9x FY18 earnings, which appears inexpensive in light of superior return ratio, valuation of itsMozambiqueasset and earnings growth.""]"

Besides, traders may also evince interest in Bajaj Finserve andPidiliteas they are likely to be the new entrants in the index.On the other hand, the weight of DrReddy's Laboratories is likely to fall due to the buyback which will increase its promoters' holding. The quarterly tweaking of the MSCI India index will be announced on August 11 and will be effective from September 1.The MSCI stock selection is based on factors such as average traded volumes, free float market capitalisation and foreign portfolio investors (FPI) limit.According to Neeraj Agarwal, vice president at IDFC, there is a higher probability that weights of stocks such as Axis Bank, Yes Bank and Eicher Motors may be increased due to a rise in their free float shares ? shares which are available for trading other than those held by promoters. MSCI considers May 31 as the last date to compute quarterly rejig in August.However, there are a few exceptions for considering a free float changes done after the cut-off date. In the previous index rejig, weights of Maruti and Ashok Leyland were raised even when their FPI limits were increased after the cut-off date. If MSCI continues to consider the changes in FPI limit done after the cut-off date this time too, then Axis Bank, Yes Bank and BPCL will likely be accorded with a higher weightage.Axis Bank has a weight of 1.5% in the MSCI India. It increased the FPI limit twice. First, from 49% to 62% before May 31, and then to 74% on July 15. If MSCI considers May 31 as the cut-off date, Axis will have a new weight of 3.6%, but if computed on the basis of 74% FPI limit, the new weight will be 4.4%.An inclusion in the MSCI India leads to fund deployment by several passive funds in proportion to the weight assigned to the stock. A stock typically gains over the short-term if the average daily volume of the stock included in the index is lower versus the total demand by the passive funds. Foreign ETFs, whose portfolio mirrors the weight accorded by the MSCI, have invested nearly 10% of the total AUM in Indian equities.""]"

The notes will rank pari passu with other senior unsecured borrowings of BPCL,? Fitch said.BPCL draws its rating from the Government of India (GoI)?s BBB- which is a majority shareholder with 54.9% stake. ?Fitch believes the linkages remain strong despite the deregulation of diesel prices in 2014 and introduction of the direct benefit transfer scheme - which transfers subsidies directly to the consumers - for household liquefied petroleum gas (LPG),? the rating agency said.Fitch said it will reassess BPCL's linkages with the state if the state-owned oil marketing companies' policy role weakens due to further deregulation of prices for petroleum products. It will also take into consideration the government's commitment to maintaining market-based prices for already deregulated products when oil prices rise.

As part of the agreement, Kochi Refinery had contributed Rs.five crore for developmental activities in the Corporation.In this regard, a cheque for Rs.five crore was handed over to Kochi Mayor Soumini Jain by BPCL Kochi Refinery's Executive Director Prasad K Panicker yesterday in presence of Ernakulam MP K V Thomas, MLA Hibi Eden and other dignitaries.BPCL Kochi Refinery had attained the capability of processing high viscous petroleum products and indigenous crudes with the implementation of its Rs.16,500 crore Integrated Refinery Expansion Project (IREP).The project has helped Kochi Refinery to enhance its capacity to 15.5 MMTPA and produce eco-friendly products complying to BS-IV norms.Now that IREP is commissioned, Kochi Refinery is one of the few in India capable of processing heavy high viscous crude oil from Barmer oil fields in Rajasthan, the release said.The pipeline will help Kochi Refinery in importing this high viscous indigenous crude oil at a much lower cost. Also, it would help increase the production of diesel.The pipeline will also help in importing diesel or petrol from other locations in case of product shortage due to shutdown of refinery unit for maintenance or any other reason as well as for export of surplus products generated when the plants are running in fully expanded capacity of 15.5 MMPTA, the company said.""]"

This attracted the attention of consumers and opposition political parties.Hence, price increases ahead of any major political event such as major state elections used to be challenging. This appears to have changed after the introduction of dynamic pricing. Petrol prices have increased Rs 6 per litre and diesel prices Rs 3.5 a litre under the new regime.Price changes in conjunction with corresponding increases in raw material prices help BPCL protect its marketing margins and enhance earnings visibility. The marketing segment's operating profit accounts for 40-55 per cent of the total in the past three fiscals. BPCL could maintain marketing margin of Rs 1.9 per litre on auto fuel.The importance of the marketing margin can be gauged from the fact that every 50 paise per litre change can increase the projected earnings per share (EPS) 16 per cent and 15 per cent for the current and the next fiscal years, respectively .Dynamic pricing has also cushioned BPCL against artificial demand fluctuations inventory destocking and restocking by dealers ahead of major price changes.""]"

Though the final approval is still pending, the government has asked banks to evaluate the deal structure. But is the proposed deal really synergetic for the companies or is it a desperate attempt by the government to narrow the current year?s deficit hole by pushing up the capital receipts?The dealBPCL is looking to purchase either a part or whole of the government?s 54.88 percent stake in GAIL. The value of the entire stake (without any premium) is approximately worth Rs 37,758 crore as calculated on today?s price.This purchase comes at a time when the government has been expressing a desire for consolidation in the oil space to create integrated oil companies which have the potential to compete with global giants. It also falls in line with governments? targeted divestment plans for the fiscal year.related newsBuy Coal India, Dish TV, DHFL; sell Bank of Baroda: Prakash GabaCar makers push hybrids to ease buyers' transition to electric carsBuy RIL, Berger Paints, IndusInd Bank, NCC; sell PNB, Bank of Baroda: Ashwani GujralSynergies for BPCLBPCL is a state-owned oil refining and marketing company with a market capitalisation of Rs 1,07,660 crore. The company has 13 percent of India?s refining capacity and is the second largest oil marketing company in India with more than 13,500 fuel stations across the country. The company has 9 city gas distribution contracts of which 4 are in a joint venture with GAIL. It had recently announced plans to expand in the downstream gas and petrochemical segment.The proposed deal falls in line with BPCL?s plan for expansion in the downstream gas market and would give the company access to GAIL?s huge ready-made gas distribution network in the form of over 11,000 km of gas pipelines and over 850 CNG stations across the country. This would facilitate rapid expansion for BPCL in the retail market, which is much needed given the changing oil marketing landscape in the country, increased competition with the entry of foreign players and anticipated growth in consumption of cleaner fuels in the coming years.Impact on financialsThe purchase would mean significant addition to the finance cost for the company. Although the contours of the deal has not been finalized yet, assuming the deal is financed entirely via debt, it would escalate the finance costs by Rs 800-900 crore. This is around 8-9 percent of net FY17 earnings of the company. The additional debt would considerably increase the leveraging in the company and push up the debt equity ratio from the current 0.96 to 2.08. As far as\xa0GAIL is concerned, the deal would only mean a change in the ownership profile and we do not see much direct benefit prima facie.The government?s sideThe government stands to benefit the most from the deal. If we look at the broad fiscal math, the progress report so far hasn?t been too encouraging.In the current fiscal, there has been a slowdown in the tax receipts. The July collections were around 50 percent of the monthly target owing to the implementation of GST. Although the tax receipts are expected to pick up in the latter half of the year, the rate of recovery is not certain. If the current trend prevails then there might be a hit on the annual tax revenue collections.Moreover, the RBI had intimated the government last month about a lower dividend payout for the year, cutting it drastically from Rs 65,876 crore last year to Rs 30,659 crore this fiscal. This would reduce the non-tax revenue significantly. To add to the woes, the latest quarter?s GDP growth (April-June) was the lowest in the last three years. Hence, any reduction in infrastructure spending could negatively impact economic growth. Owing to these factors, there is increased pressure on the government to take the initiative to source more revenue from other avenues.According to the current year?s budget estimates the government has budgeted Rs 72,500 crore divestment. Latest figures from the department of investment and public asset management show only 26 percent of the planned annual divestment (Rs 19,078 crore) has been achieved so far. Another Rs 33,300 crore is expected to flow in with the HPCL stake sale to ONGC which would take the total receipt under divestment to around Rs.52,370 crore. The GAIL divestment would not only help the government to achieve the targeted divestment, it would rather help compensate for stumpy performance in the other revenue generating areas.Overall the deal brings about significant synergies for BPCL and would facilitate its strong and rapid expansion in the retail segment, though there would be a significant surge in debt on BPCL?s balance sheet. Further deal details are not finalised yet and feasibility of the deal would depend on the valuations. The government stands as a strong beneficiary and the deal would be a quick fix to achieving its divestment targets and reducing the year?s deficit.Follow @RuchiagrawalFor more research articles, visit ourMoneycontrol Research Page.""]"

Strong rupee and absence of any forex gains will also weigh on QoQ performance of these companies.Moreover, it also expects core gross refining margins to decline QoQ.

But it is not easy to identify and buy such stocks at right time and exit at right time. Timing is most crucial element in investing or trading. This timing can be known through Financial Astrology. Astrology is only science which can predict future correctly & guide us about sectors which have to outperform.Every year with commencement of new Samvat (Hindu New Year), astrologically, based on planetary position, certain new sectors start getting\xa0 strong astrological support & start outperforming, while some others sectors which were performing earlier start underperforming. Some sectors/stocks remains laggards. Based on our experience of over 16 years as Financial Astrologer, stocks of astrological supported sectors outperform resulting in exorbitant gains irrespective of market behavior, either bull market or bear market.During last Samavat 2072 among other sectors ? SUGAR\xa0 & PAPER sectors were predicted by us, received strong astrological support & out performed. Many stocks from Sugar sector appreciated by 600-900 percent. It should be recalled that sugar sector, despite strong remained laggard for many years and started performing only after astrological support came.Sectors which get very strong astrologicalsupport are not normally affected by downfall in the market.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/astrologers on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

This will cost Rs 1.2-1.5 lakh crore and will come up in 5-6 years from the date of land acquisition.The mega complex will require 12,000-15,000 acres and two-three sites on coast of Maharashtra are being explored.The second phase, involving a 20-mt refinery, will cost Rs 50,000-60,000 crore.IOC has been looking at the west coast for a refinery as the company found it tough to cater to requirements in West and South with its refineries mostly in the North.HPCL and BPCL too have been looking at a bigger refinery because of constraints they face at their Mumbai units.The mega west coast refinery will produce petrol, diesel, LPG, ATF and feedstock for petrochemical plants in plastic, chemical and textile industries in Maharashtra.Fifteen-million tonne a year is the biggest refinery any public sector unit has set up at one stage. IOC recently started its 15 mt unit at Paradip in Odisha.Reliance Industries holds the distinction of building the biggest refinery in India till now. It built its first refinery at Jamnagar in Gujarat with a capacity of 27 mt, which was subsequently expanded to 33 mt. It has built another unit adjacent to it for exports, with a capacity of 29 mt.The refinery being planned by the state-owned firms will be bigger than that.

The International Energy Agency expects India to account for a quarter of global energy use by 2040.BPCL, the country\'s second-biggest state refiner, aims to lift its crude processing capacity to 1.18 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2022 from the current 730,000 bpd, its head of refineries R. Ramachandran told Reuters on Wednesday.In the fiscal year to March 2016, Indian fuel demand rose to its highest level in at least 15 years partly because of the nation\'s renewed manufacturing push under Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s \'Make In India\' drive.""We are aiming for an economic growth rate of 7 to 8 percent so if that happens, Indian fuel demand is bound to grow. We will see a (fuel demand) growth rate which will continue to remain at 6 to 7 percent at least for the next 10 to 15 years,"" Ramachandran said.related newsIndian in Pakistan jail has to wait till Jan 31 to know his fate1 million saw \'Padmaavat\' today, Viacom 18 \'humbled\' by responseAir India takes delivery of Boeing 777 aircraft for VVIP useAbout half of the planned refinery expansion spending will be used to raise the capacity of the Bina plant in central India to 320,000 bpd from 120,000 bpd.BPCL, which operates Bina in a tie-up with Oman Oil Co., will initially expand the capacity to 156,000 bpd by mid-2018, Ramachandran said, adding the overall expansion could cost 200 to 250 billion rupees (USD 3 billion to USD 3.75 billion).The refiner intends to spend about 100 billion rupees to expand its coastal plants at Kochi in southern India and Mumbai in the west.The company is currently raising the capacity of its Kochi plant by 63 percent to 310,000 bpd and plans to expand the plant to 400,000 bpd by 2022, Ramachandran said.""Mechanical completion is in-progress and final touches need to be given to some units. From next fiscal we will operate it at full capacity (of 310,000 bpd) on sustained basis,"" he said.The Mumbai refinery expansion faces limitations because of high population density and land constraints.By 2022, BPCL will raise the Mumbai capacity by about 17 percent to 280,000 bpd, he said.BPCL also intends to triple the capacity at its Numaligarh plant in northeastern Assam state from 60,000 bpd currently, he said. The company would invest about 150 billion rupees, drawn by the potential to export to neighbouring countries.""Besides meeting local demand the refinery is positioned to also supply products from the plant to Myanmar, Bangladesh and Nepal,"" Ramachandran said.However, the expansion hinges on the continuation of the federal tax incentives, he said.India gives some tax relief to refineries in the northeast to make them profitable as the fuel demand in the region is very low.']"

Investors are cheering up the stock for March quarter results. Analysts are also bullish on the stock with increased target price.Entire oil marketing companies (OMCs) pack is buzzing on buyers\' radar today withIOCandHPCLrising 7 and 8 percent respectively.Meanwhile,Bank of America Merill Lynchhas reiterated buy rating with a target price of Rs 1093 per share. Despite near-term headwinds on refining/marketing margins, the brokerage firm is positive on valuation support, prospects of margin recovery, potential reversal of inventory loss and volume growth at Kochi.\xa0 It feels that second quarter of FY17 is likely to provide a better backdrop for margins on seasonal weakness in crude price. Volume support could, however, falter on base effects and adverse price elasticity.""Rising oil prices amidst local elections have forced OMCs to take a hit on their marketing margins. Diesel margins are tracking Rs 0.6-0.65 per litre and petrol margins at Rs 0.85 in Q1FY17 versus Rs 1.3/1.5 in Q4FY16 and versus our FY17 estimates of Rs 0.7/1.2,"" it says in a report.According to BoAML, BPCL?s ability to continually raise prices increases confidence in the sustainability of their marketing freedom. Cuts in govt. excise duties can absorb USD 33 per barrel in crude. ?Cash flow concerns of the previous upcycle seem unlikely to re-emerge soon. BPCL has the best operational track record among OMCs and has demonstrated prudent capital redeployment policies,? it further adds.Morgan Stanleyalso has an overweight rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1089 per share. It expects gross refining margins to recover.Morgan Stanley is positive on BPCL and HPCL. It says key surprise in BPCL\'s Q4 result was marketing, both on volumes and margins. Marketing volume increased 13 percent (YoY) and 6 percent (QoQ).The state-owned OMC reported 10.6 percent drop in its March quarter net profit on back of slump in oil prices. Net profit in January-March quarter fell to Rs 2,549.08 crore from Rs 2,852.89 crore in the same period a year ago. Sales were down to Rs 44,197.09 crore in the fourth quarter of 2015-16 fiscal from Rs 51,346.12 crore, a year-ago. It earned USD 6.59 on turning every barrel of crude oil into fuel in 2015-16 as opposed to a gross refining margin of USD 3.62 a barrel in the previous fiscal.CLSAretains buy rating on BPCL stating that every USD 1/bbl on GRM/3 percent higher diesel volumes will add Rs 15/3 to FY17 earnings per share. It says that limited upside in the crude price, an election-free calendar for the rest of 2016 and a possible buffer in the government?s excise should ensure continuation of healthy marketing margins.It expects GRMs to recover as 2016 global oil demand growth stays above 1mbpd in the current low crude price environment, which should prevent any decline in refinery utilisation rates.""BPCL?s upcoming Kochi upgrade will drive a structural uplift in its GRMs as it benefits from higher complexity. Low process loss in a weak crude price environment and rising light heavy crude differentials in an oversupplied crude market should ensure higher complexity premiums,"" CLSA says in a report.At 10:50 hrs Bharat Petroleum Corporation was quoting at Rs 1,010.70, up Rs 84.30, or 9.10 percent on the BSE.Follow @NasrinzStory']"

However, total income fell 22.2 percent to Rs 51,966 crore.Balasubramanian said fall in the rupee did not impact marketing margin. He expects better marketing margins depending on competition and market direction.]There might be inventory loss in the second quarter, he said adding that it will depend on the price of crude and products at the end of September.He expects a fall in gross refining margin (GRM) in the second quarter. ?The spreads are coming down, especially in case of diesel,? he said adding that: ?We are hopeful that this quarter will be ending up somewhere around USD 4-5.?BPCL received compensation under the Pratyaksha Hastaantarit Laabh (PAHAL) scheme for kerosene worth Rs 604 crore. Of this, upstream contribution is Rs 200 crore and from government is Rs 400 crore, Balasubramanian said.The company?s Mozambique block project will commence once negotiations are completed with the government, he said.Below is the transcript of P Balasubramanian?s interview with CNBC-TV18's Ekta Batra and Mangalam Maloo.Ekta: First wanted to start by asking you about how much did you do in terms of inventory gains in this quarter?A: Inventory gains were of the order of around Rs 200 crore.Ekta: Can you just tell us in terms of the amount of compensation that you got from the government this quarter and why exactly did you require compensation? You could have reported profits even without it.A: Compensation is a part of the scheme as regards to Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is now under Direct Benefit Transfer of LPG (DBTL). That has come under the Pratyaksha Hastaantarit Laabh (PAHAL) scheme of thing and what is left is only kerosene which has been compensated both by a portion by upstream and a portion by the Government of India directly.Ekta: Can you just break up the compensation for us entirely?A: As regards kerosene the under recovery is somewhere around Rs 604 crore of which upstream compensation has been around Rs 200 crore and Government of India around Rs 400 crore.Mangalam: With fall of the rupee, what has happened to the marketing margins for petrol and diesel?A: Rupee fall doesn't have a direct influence on the marketing margins. Marketing margins, because the prices are being changed based upon the previous fortnight's average price of rupee as well as the rupee-dollar exchange rate as well as product prices. So as such it doesn't have much of a change on the marketing margin side.Ekta: But what were your marketing margins and may be your outlook on the same?A: Marketing margins were almost of the same levels as it was in the last year and we do not see anything on the downside. We are looking at something on the upside only depending on how the market moves ultimately and how the competition comes.Mangalam: So, in this current quarter that we are speaking about do you see any inventory losses which have occurred in this quarter itself?A: You are talking about Q1?Mangalam: Q2.A: Q2, the prices have being going down. So, there will be some inventory losses but we have to wait and watch because we are just half way through the second quarter. So, we have to wait and watch and see that at the end of September where the crude and product prices settle. Depending upon that we have to take the call, but not at this point in time.Ekta: What is your outlook on gross refining margins? You did around USD 8.5 per barrel this quarter. What is your outlook and that is quite similar to what a couple of your peers did, what are you envisaging for this?A: Yes, gross margins have been better at around USD 8.5 this quarter because of the very good spreads that we have over a period of time in this last quarter. Now the spreads are coming down, but it is again especially in case of diesel but it is catching up now; it is almost at around USD 10 now the spreads.So, we are hopeful that this quarter will be ending up somewhere around USD 4-5. We are not at the USD 8 level, but maybe around USD 4-5.Ekta: Have you heard anything from the government with regards to a possible divestment that they might be looking at?A: No, we are not hearing anything about that.Ekta: Would we also see may be what would your incremental sort of compensation be in the coming quarters if you have an idea based on where crude prices now are?A: Compensation will again be only on kerosene. DBT scheme for LPG has been already announced. So depending upon how the kerosene prices move based upon the crude and product prices that will be the compensation, almost at the same levels we expect in this current quarter.Mangalam: Could you give us an update on your Mozambique block and outlook on the business there?A: Mozambique block is still in the final stages of negotiations with the Government of Mozambique. The operator is doing the negotiations and we are expecting the finality in the next couple of months and we are hopeful that afterwards that FID will be completed soon and the project will commence.""]"

BPCL will fund the project,"" he said.OCC in 2009 paid a 50 percent premium for a re-entry into the Rs 11,397-crore Bina refinery project. The project was originally conceived through a joint venture company, BORL but the OCC did not contribute equity beyond the initial Rs 75 crore.The Omanese oil major came back to pick up 26 percent stake in the project for an additional Rs 1,220 crore.The BORL was formed as an equal joint venture company way back in 1993. However, following inordinate delays in the implementation of the project, OOC froze its investment in the company at Rs 75 crore for a two percent equity stake.BPCL, which holds 49 percent stake in the project, provided the unbridged portion of the Rs 4,000-crore equity in form of loan. The state-run firm got its loan back once OOC made payments for its 26 percent share.The remaining 25 percent is with financial institutions.BPCL also operates a 12 million tons a year refinery at Mumbai and 9.5 million tons Kochi unit. It also has majority stakes in the 3 million tons Numaligarh refinery in Assam.The official said BPCL is expanding and upgrading its Kochi refinery in Kerala to process high sulphur crudes by 2016. Kochi refinery capacity is being raised to 15.5 million tons from current 9.5 million tons.Crude grades with a high sulphur content are cheaper, and refineries that have installed speciality secondary units to process them can lower feed costs and increase their margins.Besides boosting margins with the upgrade and expansion, the refinery will also be able to produce fully Euro IV compatible petrol and diesel.Also, Numaligarh refinery capacity is being planned to be raised to 9 million tons. The expansion, however, is still at the drawing-board stage and it would hinge on tax concessions and other benefits from the central and state governments, he said.']"

Apart from a basic rate, there is special additional excise duty and additional excise duty on both types of petrol.So far, there has been a cut of about Rs 8-9 per litre in petrol and Rs 6 in diesel prices from its peak. The development has come ahead of the fortnightly review, wherein the OMCs were expected to go ahead with Rs 1-1.50 cut, but now the situation does not change.Don't miss:Global gold demand near 5-year low in Q3, India overtakes China: WGCThe market is still consolidating.

Government subsidy compensation typically comes with a delay.2QFY14 gross under-recoveries are up 42 percent Q-o-Q due to the impact of rupee depreciation and increase in crude price.For FY14/FY15, we model OMCs' subsidy sharing at nil and upstream sharing at INR 700 billion/650 billion, with the government sharing the balance.We peg refinery throughput at 5.9mmt for 2QFY14 v/s 5.9mmt in 2QFY13 and 5.6mmt in 1QFY14.We expect BPCL to report PAT of INR 3.7 billion, led by our assumption of INR 200 billion subsidy sharing by the government in 2QFY14.BPCL trades at 9.5x FY15E EPS and 1.2x FY15E BV.

""As far as consumer purchase is concerned, they are seeing a great positive because one of the big factors of petroleum price increases has got reversed,"" he told CNBC-TV18.Along with that, interest rates are also showing softening, if not a reversal. According to Srivastava, on both sides, customer has got a major benefit and that is the one trigger we were all waiting for to see whether the local buying is going to pick-up.He advises investors to look at companies with domestic plays, which are struggling to find consumers and buying demand.Also Read:Nifty to hit 10,000 by next Budget, says Raamdeo AgrawalAjay SrivastavaCEO|Dimensions ConsultingEarnings to be next trigger for market; steer clear of Bharat Fin: Dimensions ChiefInvestors buying anything that is cheap; rally to continue: ProsAjay Srivastava: Market not cheap; buy HDFC Bank for long termBelow is the verbatim transcript of Ajay Srivastava\'s interview with CNBC-TV18\'s Menaka Doshi and Senthil Chengalvarayan.Menaka: What do you make of this 8000 milestone?A: It is a great milestone for all of us. The biggest news what was coming into the market was the reduction in oil prices in retail market. It has a direct bearing on consumer buying. We are at the rates in Petrol ? exactly 12 months back we were at the same rate which makes a lot of this pain which was in the system of consumer buying going into petroleum products has now gone away from the system.So, intrinsically as far as the consumer purchase is concerned they are seeing a great positive because one of the big factors of petroleum price increases it has got reversed. I think there is more money on the table. The interest rates have shown some kind of softening if not a reversal. So, on both sides customer has got a major benefit and that is the one trigger we were all waiting for to see whether the local buying is going to pick-up. Forget institutional buying, the local buying of goods and services if that picks up then there you are talking of a macro economic fundamental change and I think the oil price reversal is one of the biggest steps in that direction.Senthil: How would you play this?A: You need to play this in my view and what we are doing is you got to be stationed in the oil marketing companies very clearly. If you are not there, it is a very under invested sector you got to be sitting there. You have got to pick up the bigger cap stocks like L&T etc and go with them.You have got to pick up things like Axis Bank which has a very wide reach in the economy. I would still say that among the top 3, Axis would give a better return because the reach in corporate sector is significantly better than the other two competitors of theirs. So, you got to look at companies and plays who are in the domestic market, who are struggling to find consumers and buying demand and that is what will see a reversal of the macro economy and the results front. So, anything with domestic is a great story out there.Menaka: Would that include let\'s say PSU banks or infrastructure companies or energy companies because these have all been disappointments in the earnings season that just went past?A: I don?t mean PSU banks for the reason that I think there will be a clean up of PSU banks in the next six months. Lot of the muck is going to come out in the balance sheets. We have already seen four forensic audits. So, I don?t think PSU plays is the place to be if you ask me.Power companies, yes if you are a long-term investor they will give you 20-30 percent annualised return by any measure. Their valuation has come down of late but we would tend to believe that things like Tata Power, Indiabulls Power - these kind of companies are going to come back and give you proper values over the longer term, but PSU banks I would not say are a place that you want to be today for the simple reason that developments are going to be negative in them which is positive for the rest of the economy, that is the good part. So, negative for them positive for us, so don?t want to be in that sector.Senthil: You said oil marketing is a buy, but just give us your top picks?A: For disclosure, BPCL we have kept as the top pick for the last few months. It still remains as the number one pick ? BPCL. At number two we have picked up IOC as the second bet today. So, if you want to allocate 60 percent should go to BPCL and 40 percent to IOC.Senthil: You said you are bullish on domestic stories, bullish on selective cyclical\\\\\'s. So, will money move out of pharma and IT or is it a hold there and not necessarily a sell?A: I don?t think money will move out of pharma. I think you will see some small correction then money will go back to it and it will go to the bigger names not the small or the midcaps in my view.Number two is the fact that the IT companies I don?t think so they will give relatively better returns compared to the other sectors today. They may still perform well but the relative rate of return on IT companies would be lower. However within the IT companies you have got to pick and choose and our pick has also been Tech Mahindra would give a better return on capital in the next six months than many other stocks.']"

Under this project 6500 outlets of BPCL (almost 50% of BPCL??s retail base) will be automated using Innoviti??s payments platform uniPAY, closely integrated with Orpak??s fuel automation system. The technology will be running off over 20,000 payment terminals spread across the country.There are more than 30 million customers that visit 13,000 outlets of BPCL daily as per BPCL Annual Report, 2014-15. Based on industry data, while more than Rs 7,000 Crores of payments happen through cards at these outlets, it constitutes less than 5% of overall fuel retail sales of BPCL. Increasing cashless acceptance helps the customer, outlet and the petroleum company create opportunities for increasing sales and drive cashless acceptance in the country. Even the Government of India has recently recommended steps to incentivize e-payments at retail outlets through a draft Cabinet note submitted by the Ministry of Finance.Innoviti and Orpak have partnered to deliver a unique solution to BPCL using Innoviti??s uniPAY payments platform. This helps provide an end-to-end integration for BPCL, from fueling to payment cycle. The solution enhances customer experience by cutting down the payment time and bringing payment acceptance from back office to forecourt. The improvement in attendant productivity and an end-to-end integration provides BPCL with a full control on the outlet level operations for better control. The platform also allows BPCL to seamlessly add new payment options and provides them with customer insights that helps them increase sales.uniPAY is India??s only omni-channel payments platform that allows a business to accept payments through all consumer channels. These could be online, offline, mobile or delivery. The solution capabilities also open up unlimited possibilities for BPCL to explore innovative new payment options to further differentiate their services. Through this solution, BPCL has clearly emerged as the leader in applying payment automation to fuel retail.Innoviti had earlier closed its Series B round of fund of Rs 30 Crores from Catamaran Ventures and New India Investment Corporation. The company has since actively applied the funds for marketing, product development and enhancing the overall payments infrastructure. Innoviti has added several new features to its product line while enhancing the core processing engine multifold to address processing of up to 10 million transactions a day across multiple channels. The BPCL project clearly positions Innoviti and Orpak as the leaders in fuel payment automation.Quotes:??We are very happy to be enabling this solution for BPCL in partnership with Innoviti.\xa0 BPCL needed a superior solution with state-of-the art features. Our solution helps them in improving the overall customer experience at the retail outlet while providing insights into the customer buying behavior that can help BPCL drive higher efficiency and enhance sales.\xa0 We believe the leadership taken by BPCL with this solution will set the trend for cashless acceptance at petroleum outlets??said Dharmesh Joshi, Managing Director, Orpak.??We believe that the leadership taken by BPCL in adopting superior payment platforms for delivering best-in-class customer experience will change the way cashless acceptance happens in fuel retail.

The unit with a capacity of 6.0 MMTPA at a cost of Rs. 1419 Crores is a replacement of old Crude and Vacuum units of the refinery.This refinery of BPCL was commissioned in 1955 by Burmah Shell Refineries Ltd with a capacity of 2.2 MMTPA. Post-nationalisation in 1976, the refinery has expanded through low cost revamps and adoption of new technologies. Currently, it has an installed capacity of 12.0 MMTPA with three Crude & Vacuum Distillation units with matching secondary processing and treatment facilities.The commissioning of this new CDU would ensure cleaner environment and efficient use of energy with lower emissions and reduction in energy consumption. The Sulphur dioxide emission from this new unit would be less than 10.5 mt/d ? the lowest in the country amongst all the refineries. Tightly heat integrated with furnaces of higher efficiency, the reduction in energy consumption in terms of Liquid Fuel Equivalent (LFE) is expected to be about 30 % which results into estimated savings of Rs. 128 crores per annum on fuel consumption.The integral part of this new CDU is its superior design and safety features.This has resulted in significantly lesser number of equipments as compared to older units and facilitates better turnaround management during shutdown and routine maintenance. The unit is designed with the latest safety features like blast-proof control room and closed drainage system, thus making it an efficient, intrinsically safe and sustainable unit, with higher distillate yield of 3% and thus contributing to higher Refining margins.Looking ahead, the stabilization of this unit would help in dismantling the old 1955 CDU units, thereby creating space for refinery modernization to meet future auto fuel norms and other profitability enhancing projects.Speaking on the occasion the Dharmendra\xa0 Pradhan announced the plan of setting up of a new refinery in Maharashtra.

BHARAT PETROLEUM CORP  LT,IIFL,[],26-08-2015 07:57,['India Infoline News Servic'],"Fitch affirms Bharat Petroleum at 'BBB-', Outlook Stable","['BPCL', 'Oil', 'Fitch']","BPCL's working-capital requirements fell sharply in the year ended March 2015 (FY15), with INR 130bn released as working-capital changes.","[""Fitch Ratings has affirmed India-basedBharat Petroleum Corporation Limited's (BPCL)Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR), its senior unsecured rating, and ratings on its outstanding senior unsecured debt at 'BBB-'. The Outlook is Stable.KEY RATING DRIVERSStrong Government Linkage: BPCL has close linkages - operationally and strategically - with its 54.9% shareholder, the Indian state (BBB-/Stable). The rating is equalised with that of India, based on Fitch's Parent and Subsidiary Linkage criteria. The linkages remain steady despite deregulation of diesel prices in October 2014. In our view, the state-owned downstream oil refining and marketing companies continue to remain important policy tools of the state, and will be used for meeting its socio economic objectives when required.Fall in Working-Capital Needs: BPCL's working-capital requirements fell sharply in the year ended March 2015 (FY15), with INR130bn released as working-capital changes. The main reason for the fall was lower inventory costs (INR174bn, versus INR232bn at FYE14), due to lower crude oil prices. The diesel deregulation also resulted in lower subsidy requirements. Gross under-recoveries (URs, the loss between the international prices and the regulated prices of certain petroleum products) fell to INR161bn from INR345bn in FY14. This led to a reduction in the government subsidy outstanding to BPCL to INR59bn at end-March 2015 from INR106bn a year earlier.Significant Player: BPCL is the third-largest refiner in the country, with a capacity of 30.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) that accounted for 14% of India's capacity, and the second-largest marketer of petroleum products with around a 20% market share. BPCL marketed 34.95mtpa in FY15 (FY14: 34.31mtpa), and refined 29.27mtpa (FY14: 28.69mtpa) of petroleum products. Revenue was INR2,370bn (FY14: INR2578bn), EBITDA INR98bn (INR94bn) and net profit INR48bn (INR39bn).Revenue was INR519bn in 1QFY16, EBITDA INR38bn, and net profit INR24bn. The gross refining margin (GRM) for the period was USD8.55 per barrel, much higher than historical levels in the range of USD3.5-4.5 per barrel. Fitch believes that the Q1FY16 GRMs are not likely to be sustained, as they are on account of exceptionally high product margins due to maintenance shut-down by some refineries and one-off inventory gains.High Capex: BPCL has outlined fairly high capex of more than INR400bn over the next four years. The largest portion is for the expansion of the Kochi refinery to 15.5mtpa from the current 9.5mtpa, at a cost of around INR165bn. The high capex is likely to lead to continued negative FCF over the period.Upstream Discoveries: BPCL has 17 upstream blocks (seven in India and 10 abroad), from which it has some successful discoveries. The most notable is its 10% participating interest in the Rovuma Basin in Mozambique, wherein more than 75 trillion cubic feet of natural gas resources has been discovered. This project also plans to set up a natural gas liquefaction plant with two trains, with an initial capacity of 6mtpa each. The other noteworthy discoveries are in its Brazilian assets (20% participating interest), and West Australian onshore assets in Perth (27.8% stake).Comfortable Financial Profile: BPCL had cash and cash equivalents of INR85bn at end-March 2015 (end March 2014: INR69bn) and also enjoys access to both international and domestic capital markets. Net leverage (net debt/EBITDA) had improved to 1.7x by FYE15 (FYE14: 2.8x), and interest cover to 7.9x (FY14: 4.8x). Fitch expects strong cash flow (FY15 FFO: INR74bn). The inventory costs - and subsequently debt - will increase with a rise in crude oil prices, which is Fitch's base case - and reflected in the agency's oil & gas price deck. We expect net leverage to rise to around 3x over the next three years.""]"

The assignment of the final rating follows a review of the final documentation materially conforming to the draft documentation previously received.","[""Fitch Ratings has assigned India-based Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited's (BPCL; BBB-/Stable) 4% USD500m senior unsecured notes due 2025 a final rating of 'BBB-'. The notes are issued out of its USD2bn medium-term note programme, rated 'BBB-'.The notes will constitute direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of BPCL. The assignment of the final rating follows a review of the final documentation materially conforming to the draft documentation previously received. The final rating is the same as the expected rating assigned on 22 April 2015.Key Rating DriversStrong Government Linkage:BPCL has very strong linkages - operationally and strategically - with its 54.9% shareholder, the Indian state (BBB-/Stable). Its rating is equalised with that of India based on Fitch's Parent and Subsidiary Linkage criteria. BPCL continues to sell public distribution kerosene and household LPG at below market prices under a regulated pricing regime, although diesel prices were deregulated in October 2014. We believe that BPCL continues to be a strategically important entity for the state.Before the deregulation of diesel pricing, the prices of around two thirds of the petroleum products (including retail diesel, public distribution kerosene and household LPG) marketed by BPCL were regulated by the government, and sold at prices lower than international market prices. The government funded these under recoveries (UR; difference between market prices and regulated prices) partly through direct budgetary support and partly by directing upstream oil companies to provide discounts to BPCL.Significant Player:BPCL is the third-largest refiner in the country with a capacity of 30.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) that accounted for 14% of capacity in India, and the second-largest marketer of petroleum products with a 21% market share. In the financial year ended March 2014 (FY14), BPCL marketed 34.3mtpa (FY13: 33.7mtpa) domestically, exported 3.1mtpa (FY13: 3.2mtpa) and refined 28.7mtpa (FY13: 28.6mtpa) of petroleum products.Under Recoveries Impact Working Capital and Debt:BPCL's gross UR in FY14 was INR345bn (FY13: INR390bn), which was covered by government subsidies of INR184bn (FY13: INR219bn) and discounts from upstream players of INR156bn (FY13: INR168bn). BPCL shouldered INR5.1bn of the UR (FY13: INR2.5bn). BPCL's working capital position had been impacted because of delays in the receipt of subsidy payments from the state.Diesel accounted for 52% of BPCL's FY14 UR, but the amount of diesel UR is likely to decline substantially following the deregulation of diesel pricing. Further, the fall in oil prices to below USD50 per barrel in January 2015 from more than USD100 a year ago, will also help bring down inventory costs. These two events will reduce BPCL's working capital requirements and the short-term debt required to fund it.High Capex Planned:The company has outlined a fairly high capex of more than INR300bn over the next four years. The largest part of the capex is for the expansion of the Kochi refinery to 15.5mtpa from the current 9.5mtpa at a cost of around INR165bn. The high capex is likely to lead to continued negative free cash flows over the next four to five years.Upstream Discoveries:BPCL has 18 upstream blocks (eight in India and 10 abroad), from which it has some successful discoveries - notably in the Rovuma Basin in Mozambique (in which it has 10% participating interest), in its Brazilian assets (20% participating interest), and West Australian onshore assets in Perth (27.8% stake). The Mozambique asset is assessed at having recoverable resources of 50trn-70trn cubic feet of natural gas, and the investors in the project also plan to set up a natural gas liquefaction plant with two trains with an initial capacity of 5mtpa each.Financial Profile to Weaken:At FYE14, BPCL had a net leverage (net debt/EBITDA) of 2.8x (FYE13: 3.8x) and interest cover of 4.7x (FYE13: 2.6x). With BPCL likely to generate negative free cash flows due to high capex, Fitch expects the company's net leverage to increase over the next two to three years. BPCL has a comfortable liquidity position with cash and cash equivalents of INR50bn at end-September 2014 (FYE14: INR69bn). The company also enjoys good access to international and domestic capital markets.Key AssumptionsFitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include:The URs and the corresponding budgetary support requirements fall substantially in FY15 and decrease further in FY16Profitability falls in FY15 due to inventory losses as crude oil price has fallenRating SensitivitiesBPCL's rating is equalised with that of India.Positive:Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action includeAn upgrade of India's sovereign rating provided that BPCL's current linkages with the state are maintainedNegative:Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action includeA downgrade of India's sovereign ratingA weakening of BPCL's linkages with the stateFor the sovereign rating of India, the following sensitivities were outlined by Fitch in its Rating Action Commentary of 9 April 2015.The main factors that individually or collectively could lead to positive rating action are:Fiscal consolidation or fiscal reforms that would cause the general government debt burden to fall more rapidly than expectedAn improved business environment resulting from implemented reforms and structurally lower inflation levels, which would support higher investment and real GDP growthThe main factors that individually or collectively could lead to negative rating action are:Deviation from the fiscal consolidation path, leading to persistence of the high public debt burden, or greater-than-expected deterioration in the banking sector's asset quality that would prompt large-scale financial support from the sovereignLoose macroeconomic policy settings that cause a return of persistently high inflation levels and a widening current account deficit, which would increase the risk of external funding stress.""]"

BHARAT PETROLEUM CORP  LT,IIFL,[],28-01-2015 11:29,['India Infoline News Service'],Fitch rates BPCL's US$2bn MTN Programme 'BBB-',"['Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited', 'BPCL', 'Fitch Ratings']","BPCL has very strong linkages - operationally and strategically - with its 54.9% shareholder, the Indian state (BBB-/Stable).","[""Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB-' rating to India-based Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited's (BPCL; BBB-/Stable) USD2bn medium-term note programme.Key Rating DriversStrong Government Linkage:BPCL has very strong linkages - operationally and strategically - with its 54.9% shareholder, the Indian state (BBB-/Stable). Its rating is equalised with that of India based on Fitch's Parent and Subsidiary Linkage criteria. BPCL continues to sell public distribution kerosene and household LPG at below market prices under a regulated pricing regime, although diesel prices were deregulated in October 2014. We believe that BPCL continues to be a strategically important entity for the state.Before the deregulation of diesel pricing, the prices of around two thirds of the petroleum products (including retail diesel, public distribution kerosene and household LPG) marketed by BPCL were regulated by the government, and sold at prices lower than international market prices. The government funded these under recoveries (UR; difference between market prices and regulated prices) partly through direct budgetary support and partly by directing upstream oil companies to provide discounts to BPCL.Significant Player:BPCL is the third-largest refiner in the country with a capacity of 30.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) that accounted for 14% of capacity in India, and the second-largest marketer of petroleum products with a 21% market share. In the financial year ended March 2014 (FY14), BPCL marketed 34.3mtpa (FY13: 33.7mtpa) domestically, exported 3.1mtpa (FY13: 3.2mtpa) and refined 28.7mtpa (FY13: 28.6mtpa) of petroleum products.Under Recoveries Impact Working Capital and Debt:BPCL's gross UR in FY14 was INR345bn (FY13: INR390bn), which was covered by government subsidies of INR184bn (FY13: INR219bn) and discounts from upstream players of INR156bn (FY13: INR168bn). BPCL shouldered INR5.1bn of the UR (FY13: INR2.5bn). BPCL's working capital position has been impacted because of delays in the receipt of subsidy payments from the state.Diesel accounted for the 52% of BPCL's FY14 UR, but the amount of diesel UR is likely to decline substantially following the deregulation of diesel pricing. Further, the fall in oil prices to below USD50 per barrel in January 2015 from more than USD100 a year ago, will also help bring down inventory costs. These two events will reduce BPCL's working capital requirements and the short-term debt required to fund it.High Capex Planned:The company has outlined a fairly high capex of more than INR300bn over the next four years. The largest part of the capex is for the expansion of the Kochi refinery to 15.5mtpa from the current 9.5mtpa at a cost of around INR165bn. The high capex is likely to lead to continued negative free cash flows over the next four to five years.Upstream Discoveries:BPCL has 20 upstream blocks (eight in India and 12 abroad), from which it has some successful discoveries - notably in the Rovuma Basin in Mozambique (in which it has 10% participating interest), in its Brazilian assets (20% participating interest), and West Australian onshore assets in Perth (27.8% stake). The Mozambique asset is assessed at having recoverable resources of 50trn-70trn cubic feet of natural gas, and the investors in the project also plan to set up a natural gas liquefaction plant with two trains with an initial capacity of 5mtpa each.Credit Profile to Weaken:At FYE14, BPCL had a net leverage (net debt/EBITDA) of 2.8x (FYE13: 3.8x) and interest cover of 4.7x (FYE13: 2.6x). With BPCL likely to generate negative free cash flows due to high capex, Fitch expects the company's net leverage to increase to around 5x over the next two to three years. BPCL has a comfortable liquidity position with cash and cash equivalents of INR50bn at end-September 2014 (FYE14: INR69bn). The company also enjoys good access to international and domestic capital markets.Rating SensitivitiesBPCL's rating is equalised with that of India.Positive:Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action includeAn upgrade of India's sovereign rating provided that BPCL's current linkages with the state are maintainedNegative:Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action includeA downgrade of India's sovereign ratingA weakening of BPCL's linkages with the stateFor the sovereign rating of India, the following sensitivities were outlined by Fitch in its Rating Action Commentary of 11 April 2014. The main factors that individually, or collectively, could trigger negative rating action include:Deviation from the fiscal consolidation path in such a way that it results in continuation of large general government budget deficits.A prolonged period of disappointing real GDP growth, for instance in the context of a further deteriorating investment climate.A loose macro policy setting that would cause inflationary pressures to persist and/or the current account to widen to such an extent that it would lead to external funding stress.Greater-than-expected deterioration in the banking sector's asset quality that would prompt large-scale financial support from the sovereign.The main factors that individually, or collectively, could trigger positive rating action on India include:Sustained fiscal consolidation or fiscal reforms, which lead to a sharp decline in the ratio of gross general government debt to GDP.New reform momentum with the implementation of far-reaching reforms that raise the potential growth rate.Establishing a credible low inflation environment, for example through the use of a transparent and clear monetary policy framework and tackling structural impediments to lower food price inflation.""]"

In absence of these pay-outs, companies also have reported net loss in some of the earlier quarters.Analysts? estimates thus also vary. The sharp fall in BPCL?s net profit could also be attributed to the over-recovery of about Rs 1,830 crore in the September 2012 quarter towards subsidy and forex gain of Rs 1,170 crore, leading to a high base effect in the quarter gone by.

The crude throughput stood at 6.04 million tonnes (mt) in the quarter, up 1.7 per cent year-on-year, while sales volume was largely unchanged at 7.79 mt versus 7.77 mt in the year-ago period, owing to slowing demand for petrol.', 'Overall, numbers were better than Street expectations.TheBPCLscrip, which was gradually trending lower through the day, fell from Rs 337 levels to an intra-day low of Rs 329.05 before closing down two per cent compared to the previous day?s close of Rs 339.85.

Chairman and Managing DirectorS VaradarajantellsKalpana Pathakthe company has ambitious plans for growth and going global, not only in the upstream but downstream segment, too. Excerpts:How do you view BPCL?s performance this year?We have done pretty well. For the first time, net profit has exceeded Rs 5,000-crore. Profit after tax stood at Rs 5,048.5 crore against Rs 4,060 crore in 2013-14. The gross refining margins generated by our refineries at Kochi and Mumbai continue to be the highest among public sector refineries. Internal cash generation during the year was higher at Rs 5,989 crore, 30 per cent more than Rs 4,585 crore in 2013-14.What are the growth plans and segments?Our teams of 100-plus people have taken nearly eight to nine months in devising an integrated corporate strategy document designated ?Project Sankalp? ? our resolve to take the next giant leap. The project has taken into account our growth strategy for 2016-2021.As part of this, BPCL will invest Rs 1,00,000 crore in the next five years.In the upstream segment, we will invest up to Rs 20,000-25,000 crore. The refining segment will see investments of Rs 35,000-40,000 crore, wherein we aspire to reach a capacity of one million barrels per day in the next four to five years. The balance investment goes into marketing and city gas distribution. We also have plans to go to countries, including Nepal and Bangladesh, and some African nations, where, in addition to marketing lubricants, we would look at options to get into the downstream segment.How do you plan to reach refining capacity of one million barrels per day?Bina and Numaligarh refineries can help us achieve this. We are planning to take Numaligarh capacity from three million tonnes to nine million tonnes per annum and a proposal in this regard has been approved by the board. We have submitted a proposal to the government seeking capital subsidy for the same. Since crude availability is a problem in the northeast, we need to move it from the east coast to Numaligarh.', 'There is an integrated plan for Numaligarh of Rs 20,000 crore.As for Bina, the first quarter of this financial year turned profitable. Bina is currently stabilised at six million tonnes. It is operating at full capacity. We have approved a low-cost expansion and de-bottlenecking for it. This will take up the capacity from six million tonne to 7.8 million tonnes, operating close to around eight million tonnes. The cost is going to be about Rs 3,000 crore.We have sought approvals for making fresh investments into Bina. Our partner?Oman Oil Company?is not going to participate as in this round of expansion. Sometime next year, we might look at a public issue or bring in a strategic partner as part of the larger equity correction. We do have plans to take up Bina ultimately to 15 million tonnes. Demand in that belt and in the central and northern part is very attractive. We need to meet these products from moving from the coast.Considering the decline in crude oil prices, have you reviewed the returns on the assets held by your upstream arm, Bharat Petro Resources?Yes, returns have to be reviewed in the light of the current drop in crude oil and product prices. Fortunately for us, most investments are in the initial stage. However, a good aspect of the drop is that service cost has come down and, thus, contracting for the field will also happen at a lesser price.We should get into a final investment decision with regard to our Mozambique field at the end of this year. By the time our projects come on stream, that is in four years, crude oil and product prices would have stabilised, providing us reasonable rate of returns. Besides, due to the size of discovery in Mozambique, we are not worried about it as of now.']"
